/**
 * Live Coding: apply a C++ change to the editor that is already running.
 *
 * Every other leg of this bridge can finish a job on its own. The C++ leg could not. A model could
 * find a bug in native code, write the fix, and prove it compiles with `compile_cpp` - and then the
 * change sat on disk, because the running editor holds the DLL it was built from. The last step was
 * always a human closing the editor, rebuilding, and reopening it. A human does not do that; a human
 * presses Ctrl+Alt+F11.
 *
 * This is that keystroke. It is deliberately two thin commands rather than one blocking one:
 *
 *   live_coding_compile   starts a compile and returns immediately
 *   live_coding_status    says whether it is still going, and hands back what it logged
 *
 * The blocking form exists in the engine - `Compile(WaitForCompletion)` - and is wrong here for two
 * separate reasons, both of which cost a session to learn elsewhere in this project. It spins on
 * `FPlatformProcess::Sleep` on the game thread, so this plugin's own ticker never runs and the reply
 * cannot be flushed; the client times out and reports the editor as hung. And it opens a modal slow
 * task dialog, which is the exact failure `blockingDialogTitle()` on the server side exists to
 * diagnose: a modal window owns the main thread and every later command hangs behind it.
 *
 * So the waiting happens on the Node side, where waiting is free. The model spends one tool call.
 *
 * What is captured, and why it is the interesting half: LogLiveCoding is where the engine writes the
 * outcome, including the two warnings that matter more than the result itself - a patch that changed
 * data types with re-instancing disabled says so, and says it "will likely lead to a crash". A tool
 * that reported "Success" and dropped that line would be lying in the most expensive possible way.
