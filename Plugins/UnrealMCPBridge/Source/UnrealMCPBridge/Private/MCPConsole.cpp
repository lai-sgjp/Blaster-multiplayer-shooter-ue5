/**
 * The console. One command, and a large fraction of "everything a human has" arrives with it.
 *
 * Almost every tool in this bridge is a specific verb: create this, connect that, read the other.
 * The console is the opposite shape and that is exactly why it belongs here - it is the one thing a
 * person at the keyboard reaches for when the specific verb does not exist yet. `ce StartWave` to
 * fire an event that nothing is calling yet. `Ke * ResetHealth` to call a function on every instance
 * of a class. `stat unit` to see whether the frame cost is the game thread or the GPU. `slomo 0.1` to
 * watch something that happens too fast to see. `r.ScreenPercentage 50`. `showdebug abilitysystem`.
 * `DisableAllScreenMessages`. None of those need a tool of their own, and defining a tool for each
 * would cost a session more standing context than the whole console does.
 *
 * The care is all in reporting honestly, because the console is unusually good at appearing to work.
 *
 * **A misspelled command does nothing and says nothing.** Type `stat untis` and the game carries on
 * exactly as before. `UEngine::Exec` returns false for that, and this reports it as `recognised:
 * false` rather than as a success with empty output. That distinction is the whole difference between
 * a model that notices its typo and a model that concludes the engine ignored a working command.
 *
 * **Most commands answer through the log, not to the caller.** `stat fps` returns an empty string and
 * writes elsewhere; so do the cvars, so does `showdebug`. A tool that reported only the return value
 * would say nothing about almost every command worth running. So the log is captured for the length
 * of the exec and handed back with it.
 *
 * **In a running game the console belongs to the player controller.** `ce`, cheats, and anything the
 * cheat manager owns are routed through `APlayerController::ConsoleCommand`, not through the engine.
 * Sending those to GEditor silently does nothing. So PIE goes through the player controller, which is
 * the same path the in-game console uses when a human presses the tilde key.
 *
 * **Two commands are refused.** `quit` and `exit` close the editor, and this plugin lives inside it -
 * the model would not receive an error, it would receive nothing ever again, having deleted its own
 * ability to notice. That is not a policy about what the user may do; it is the one case where
 * running the command destroys the thing that would report on it.
