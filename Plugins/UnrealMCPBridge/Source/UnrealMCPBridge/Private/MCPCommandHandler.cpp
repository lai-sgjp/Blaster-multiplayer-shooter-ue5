/**

 * Everything else here reads assets: what a Blueprint SAYS it will do. This reads what it DOES. The

 * server has and the client does not, an actor that never spawns. None of that is visible in a
 * graph, and all of it is obvious in three seconds of a running game.
 *
 * Two things make it worth building rather than telling somebody to press Play.
 *
 * FIRST, IT SAMPLES EVERY PIE WORLD, LABELLED BY NET ROLE. The most expensive bug class this project
 * finds - a server writing state that never reaches clients - reads as "it works for the host" and
 * cannot be reproduced by one person. With two PIE clients running, "Authority: 0 -> 47, Client: 0 ->
 * 0" is the entire bug, observed rather than argued. Static analysis says that variable is not
 * replicated; this says nobody ever received it.
 *
 * SECOND, IT DOES NOT BLOCK THE GAME THREAD. The obvious implementation - loop, read, sleep, read -
 * is worse than useless: the bridge runs ON the game thread, so sleeping stops the world ticking and
 * every sample comes back identical. Nothing would change because nothing would be running. So the
 * sampling is a ticker and the reads are separate calls: start, let real time pass, read.
 *
 * The reply is a verdict, not a table. Forty samples of a float is forty numbers nobody reads; the
 * answer to "does this ever change" is one word, and the distinct values behind it are worth about a
 * line. Reporting the raw trajectory would cost more tokens than reading the whole Blueprint.

/**
 * Find a pin, accepting a near-miss, and say what was accepted.
 *
 * Found by benchmarking a 7B local model against a real task. It wrote "done" for the exec output
 * of an event node. The error said, correctly, `output pin 'done' not found (available: then)` -
 * naming the right answer - and the model reissued the identical call ELEVEN TIMES before the step
 * limit stopped it. A message that contains the answer is not the same as a message a weak model
 * can act on, and that gap is exactly what this project claims to close.
 *
 * So near-misses are resolved rather than rejected, under rules that cannot silently do the wrong
 * thing:
 *
 *   - case-insensitive and underscore/space-insensitive match: "Then", "then_0" style typos
 *   - a common alias for the same concept ("done", "out", "output" for an exec output)
 *   - and, only when the node has EXACTLY ONE pin of that direction and kind, that pin
 *
 * The last rule is the powerful one and the one that needs the guard: with one exec output there
 * is no other thing the caller could have meant. A Branch has two, so nothing is guessed there and
 * the caller gets the list instead.
 *
 * Every correction is reported back, so the caller learns the real name instead of being quietly
 * carried. Silent forgiveness would teach a model nothing and hide genuine mistakes.

/**
 * Delete state-machine transitions that duplicate another one exactly.
 *
 * anim-duplicate-transition reports two transitions out of one state, to the same state, on the
 * same rule: only the first can ever fire, and the second is almost always a copy whose condition
 * was meant to be edited and was not. The check shipped without any way to act on it, which is the
 * same gap rename_function was written to close - a finding whose remedy names something this
 * bridge cannot do.
 *
 * ## Why this and not "delete a transition"
 *
 * A general delete is the more capable tool and the more dangerous one: removing the wrong
 * transition is how a state ends up with no way out, which is the single most expensive animation
 * bug there is and one this project already has a check for. This cannot cause that, by
 * construction - it only ever removes a transition that has an identical twin, so every
 * (from, to, rule) that existed before still exists after. The graph does strictly less, in the
 * only way that changes nothing.
 *
 * Identity is (destination, rule text), compared with the same DescribeTransitionRule the reader
 * and the check already use. Two transitions to the same state on DIFFERENT rules are ordinary -
 * two ways of reaching one state - and are left alone.

 * class actually descends from the class that owns the property; otherwise it is always included,
 * which is correct anyway - a Blueprint's own variable defaults are exactly what somebody chose.

// single fact - ServerSkinMemory is READ in one place and WRITTEN in none, so the lookup that decides
// which skin you keep always misses - and establishing that fact meant opening nine Blueprints one at
// a time and grepping each one's graphs. A frontier model would have paid the same nine round trips
// for the same one sentence.
//
// "Written nowhere but read somewhere" is a whole class of bug on its own: the half-built feature.
// The reading side exists, looks finished, compiles, and silently takes the fallback branch forever.
// Nothing in Unreal warns about it, and it is invisible from any single asset - which is exactly why
// it needs a project-wide answer rather than a per-Blueprint one.
//
// Cast-and-set is why this cannot be narrowed to the declaring Blueprint and its children: GM_Gameplay
// reaches AVS_GameInstance's variable through a cast, and any scan that only looked at the owner would
// have reported zero of everything and been confidently wrong.
// Can execution reach this node from an event at all?
//
// Walk the exec wires backwards. A node whose chain ends at an Event, a Custom Event or a Function
// Entry is live; a node whose chain just stops is in a graph fragment nothing runs. That second case
// is not rare and it is not obviously visible: a system gets replaced, whoever replaced it unplugged
// the front of the old one, and everything behind it stays on the canvas looking exactly like
// working code.
/**
 * Does execution START here?
 *
 * The obvious test - IsA<UK2Node_Event> - misses the single most important node kind in a modern
 * project. UK2Node_EnhancedInputAction does NOT derive from UK2Node_Event; it derives from UK2Node
 * and implements IK2Node_EventNodeInterface. So every Enhanced Input node read like ordinary
 * mid-chain logic, and modern Unreal drives everything through Enhanced Input: movement, jump,
 * fire, interact.
 *
 * What that produced was not a missing feature but a confidently wrong one. explain_graph listed 25
 * entry points for a real player Blueprint and not one input action, so whole features were absent
 * from the summary a model reads first. Worse, trace_function_calls declared a live, working ping
 * system dead - "Every call is dead... Do not fix it; find what took over" - about a chain that
 * runs every time the player presses the key. A model that believes that deletes working code.
 *
 * The interface is the honest test rather than a list of class names, because a list of class names
 * is the thing that goes stale next time Epic adds a node kind.

// Which graphs in this project can actually run.
//
// The first version of this answered "can execution reach this node from an entry", which is the
// right question inside one graph and the wrong one across a project: a FUNCTION graph always has an
// entry node, so every call inside it read as reachable even when nothing in the project called that
// function. Measured on a real project, that reported four live call sites where two of them were in
// functions nobody calls.
//
// So reachability is computed to a fixpoint instead:
//
//   - an Event Graph is live (its events can fire),
//   - a function graph is live if some LIVE graph calls it at a call site that is itself reachable,
//   - repeat until nothing new becomes live.
//
// Timers are why this also reads pin defaults. Set Timer by Function Name passes its target as a
// STRING, so a call graph built only from CallFunction nodes cannot see it - AttemptSkinUpdate on a
// real project showed as called by nobody when a timer starts it every tick. Recovering that edge
// from the pin's default text turns an invisible caller into a visible one.
//
// What this still cannot see, and it is written here rather than pretended away: events bound to
// delegates at runtime, anything called only from C++, and a Custom Event that nothing ever calls
// still counts its graph as live because it lives in an Event Graph.
// Every node in a graph that execution can reach, in one forward pass.
//
// The first version asked "can this node be reached" per call node, walking exec wires backwards
// each time. Correct, and far too slow: on a 339-Blueprint project it ran a recursive walk for every
// CallFunction node in the project and blew through the bridge's 60 second budget, so the answer
// never arrived. Marking the whole graph once and then testing membership is the same answer for a

 * property is compared against it: identical ones are skipped entirely, and the rest export as a
 * delta, which prunes untouched members out of nested structs as well.

//
// This is deliberately generic over UObject rather than special-cased to DataAsset. The same two
// handlers cover CurveFloat, SoundClass, MaterialParameterCollection and anything else that is an
// asset with properties on it, because the machinery - find the FProperty, export or import its text
// - does not care what the outer class is. Writing five type-specific tools would have cost five

/**
 * Step back over this bridge's OWN transactions, and stop dead at anything else.
 *
 * undo_history has always been a read, and its note said so: "undo is performed by a human in the
 * editor". That was a defensible default and it leaves a model with no reverse gear, which is not a
 * theoretical gap - it was written after a cleanup_blueprint call did more than intended to a
 * Blueprint a team shares, and the only routes back were asking a person to press Ctrl+Z twenty
 * times or reverting the asset and losing the good work with the bad.
 *
 * ## Why this is safe to automate and a bare undo is not
 *
 * The editor's undo stack is SHARED. A person may have moved an actor, renamed a variable or edited
 * a curve between two MCP calls, and those sit in the same queue. An undo that just pops the top
 * would silently destroy human work, and the person would have no reason to suspect it: they did not
 * run the tool.
 *
 * So this only ever undoes a transaction titled "MCP: ...", stops at the first one that is not, and
 * says why it stopped. Refusing to act is the correct outcome when a human transaction is on top -
 * the caller can see that in undo_history and decide, which is a judgement this cannot make.
