/**
 * Acting on review findings, rather than only reporting them.
 *
 * The quality gate tells a model what is wrong. A capable model then fixes it. A weaker one reads
 * the findings, says "I have reviewed the Blueprint", and moves on — which is the failure the gate
 * was built to prevent, arriving one step later.
 *
 * So the safe subset is automated. What counts as safe is the whole design question here, and the
 * answer is deliberately narrow: only changes that cannot alter what the Blueprint DOES.
 *
 *   - **Dead nodes** are safe by construction. A node wired to nothing never executes and produces
 *     no value; deleting it cannot change behaviour.
 *   - **Comment boxes and layout** are cosmetic. The compiler never sees them.
 *
 * Everything else is left to the model, on purpose:
 *
 *   - Removing a leftover Print String means healing the execution chain around it. That is a
 *     behaviour-preserving edit only if done correctly, and a tool that gets it subtly wrong breaks
 *     a working graph while reporting success.
 *   - Renaming a placeholder variable needs a name, and choosing one is judgement.
 *   - An unhandled cast failure needs a decision about what should happen on failure. Wiring it to
 *     nothing to silence the warning would be worse than the warning.
 *
 * A cleanup tool that quietly changes behaviour is far more damaging than one that leaves work on
 * the table, because the person most likely to run it is the person least able to notice.
