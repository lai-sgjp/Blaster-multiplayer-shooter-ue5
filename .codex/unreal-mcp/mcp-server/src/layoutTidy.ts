/**
 * Tidy a system's layout: make the flow read rightward, and pull its inputs in beside what reads them.
 *
 * `review_layout` says what is wrong. This fixes the two faults worth fixing mechanically, and it
 * exists because doing it by hand took three passes and produced two new bugs on the way - a node
 * moved onto another, and a pass computed against a stale snapshot. Both are the kind of mistake a
 * function does not make twice.
 *
 * ## Why it refuses to work on a whole graph
 *
 * `auto_layout_graph` relays out everything, and on a graph somebody maintains by hand that is a far
 * larger change than the one being asked for - measured once at 209 nodes moved to place four. This
 * takes a SCOPE and moves nothing outside it, so tidying what you added cannot disturb what was
 * already there. A call with no scope is refused rather than quietly interpreted as "all of it".
 *
 * ## The two passes
 *
 * **Straighten.** Every execution wire should point rightward; that is the measurable form of "reads
 * like a book". Hand-written code in this project manages 369 exec wires with 0 backwards. A chain
 * is only monotonic if every step is, so pushing one node right can expose the next - it repeats
 * until nothing points left, rather than fixing a list of coordinates once.
 *
 * **Compact.** Pure nodes - getters, maths, casts with no exec pins - have no place they must be,
 * only a place they should be. Moving them beside what they touch took the generated system's p90
 * wire length from 1068 to 692, against 608 for the hand-built code beside it. Distance is measured
 * to everything wired to a node, in BOTH directions: the first version looked only at outputs, so a
 * node whose consumer was close but whose source was 2000 away looked settled and never moved.
 *
 * Y is left alone in the straighten pass. Rows carry meaning - a loop body on one line with its
 * inputs hanging below - and moving vertically trades one kind of mess for another.
