/**
 * Hot-reload C++ into the editor that is already running.
 *
 * This closes the one leg of this server that could not finish its own job. A model could find a bug
 * in native code, write the fix, and prove it compiles - and then the change sat on disk, because the
 * running editor holds the DLL it was built from. Applying it meant a human closing the editor,
 * rebuilding, and reopening. A human working on their own does not do that: they press Ctrl+Alt+F11.
 *
 * The bridge half is deliberately two non-blocking commands (see MCPLiveCoding.cpp for why the
 * engine's own blocking form would hang the editor and open a modal dialog). The waiting belongs
 * here, where it is free: this polls, and the model spends one tool call for the whole thing.
 *
 * The interesting work is reading the result honestly, and the engine makes that easy to get wrong.
 * Every outcome it logs starts with the same four words:
 *
 *   "Live coding succeeded"                                        - patched, running now
 *   "Live coding succeeded, no code changes detected"              - compiled nothing at all
 *   "Live coding succeeded, data type changes ... likely ... crash"- patched, and now unsafe
 *
 * A substring test for "Live coding succeeded" reports all three as a win, and the middle one is the
 * common case: a model saves a file, calls this, is told it succeeded, and concludes its fix is live
 * when nothing was rebuilt. So the checks below run most-specific first, and the no-op case has its
 * own outcome rather than sharing a word with the real one.
