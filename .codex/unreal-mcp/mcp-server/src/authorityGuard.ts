/**
 * Put a node behind an authority check, without breaking the chain it is already in.
 *
 * This is the mechanical half of the most expensive finding this project knows how to make. A
 * GameMode exists only on the server, so casting to one from a PlayerController, a Pawn, a
 * GameState or a widget fails on every client - silently, taking every node after it with it. A
 * real project had twelve of them.
 *
 * The fix is always the same shape: run that part only where it can work. What it is NOT is a
 * decision about design - moving the state to the GameState may well be the better answer, and this
 * cannot know that. It does the edit people would otherwise do by hand, correctly, and says exactly
 * what it changed.
 *
 * ## Why this and not a general "insert a node" tool
 *
 * Because the general version has to be told how to wire itself, and getting that wrong silently
 * rearranges someone's graph. This knows the one shape it is building:
 *
 *     before:   ...predecessors -> TARGET
 *     after:    ...predecessors -> Branch(HasAuthority) --true--> TARGET
 *
 * ## Safety
 *
 * Three things, in order of how much they matter:
 *
 *   - It refuses when the target has no incoming execution at all. There is nothing to guard, and
 *     guessing would mean inventing a chain.
 *   - `dryRun` reports the exact edit without making it.
 *   - Afterwards it re-reads the graph and checks the target is now reached through the Branch, and
 *     that the Blueprint still compiles. An edit tool that reports success without looking is how a
 *     working project gets broken quietly.
