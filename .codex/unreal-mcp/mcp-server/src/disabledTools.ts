/**
 * "Do this next" is worth nothing if the tool it names is switched off.
 *
 * Found once in the audit and then, on looking, in four more places. For every preset, for every
 * advice-giving tool the preset actually carries, which tools does that tool tell you to call that
 * the preset does not switch on:
 *
 *   diagnose / audit_project    call_parent_function, set_data_table_row
 *   diagnose / verify_feature   set_data_table_row
 *   diagnose / find_orphans     open_level
 *   feature  / verify_feature   set_data_table_row
 *   feature  / plan_feature     trace_function_calls
 *
 * The first version of that scan was wrong in a way worth recording: it compared every module
 * against every preset, including presets that do not contain the module's own tool, and produced a
 * list twice this long. Advice from a tool you cannot call is not a gap, it is nothing at all.
 *
 * `plan_feature` is the one that stings. It was taught to say "check the system still runs with
 * unreal_trace_function_calls before extending it" - the single most useful sentence it has, added
 * because extending a system nothing calls produces a feature that cannot work - and the preset it
 * lives in does not switch that tool on.
 *
 * The obvious repair is to put them in the presets. Measured on the audit, that costs 870 standing
 * tokens for three tools, on every request, to save one `enable_tools({tools:[...]})` of about a
 * hundred and fifty that most sessions never make. So instead the server says which named tools are
 * off, at the moment it names them, and only then.
 *
 * ## Why only the advice fields
 *
 * Scanning the whole reply would be simpler and wrong. `list_tools` names dozens of deliberately
 * disabled tools - that is its job - and `guide` quotes them in prose. A note listing all of those
 * would be noise attached to the one reply whose entire purpose is to describe what is off.
 *
 * So the fields are named: the ones that mean "your next move is this".
