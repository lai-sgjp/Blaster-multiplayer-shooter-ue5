/**
 * Named tool sets for the jobs people actually ask for.
 *
 * Measured, and this is the whole reason the file exists: naming the eight tools one Blueprint
 * feature needs costs 4,552 tokens against 11,666 for enabling the `core` group - 61% less, with the
 * five-surface feature trial still passing on a named set. The saving is real and it is not bought
 * with capability.
 *
 * But a model cannot take it. On the `search` profile it starts with four tools and no idea which
 * eight to name, so its choices are to call unreal_list_tools and reason about a catalogue, or to
 * enable `core` and pay 11,666. Guesswork stands between every session and the cheapest path, which
 * makes the cheap path an expert move rather than the default. That is a design failure, not a
 * documentation one: advice a model cannot act on without extra calls is advice that costs tokens.
 *
 * A preset is the answer to "I know what job I am doing, give me the tools for it". Deterministic,
 * not inferred - the server does not try to guess intent from a sentence, because a wrong guess
 * leaves a model without a tool it needs and no clue why.
 *
 * Two rules held while choosing these:
 *
 * - Every preset is checked against a trial that uses it, so "sufficient" means a run passed and not
 *   that the list looked complete. `trial:diagnose --by-preset` runs the whole find-and-fix loop on
 *   `diagnose` alone.
 * - When in doubt a tool is IN. A missing tool costs a round trip and a confused model; a spare one
 *   costs a few hundred tokens. Those are not the same size of mistake.

 * guessing at names, which is the most expensive mistake it can make.
