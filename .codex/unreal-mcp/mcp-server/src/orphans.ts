/**
 * Find the actors that have lost the partner they depend on.
 *
 * Levels are full of actors that only work in pairs: a nav link and the door it belongs to, a
 * trigger and the thing it triggers, a spawn point and its volume. Delete one half and the other
 * half stays behind, still ticking, still handling events, and pointing at nothing. Nothing warns,
 * because an actor with a null reference is a perfectly legal actor.
 *
 * The case that motivated this: a level had 25 nav links and 12 firewalls. Twenty-four paired off
 * two per firewall, all within 190 units. One sat 921 units from the nearest firewall - left behind
 * when a wall was deleted - and it still handled "smart link reached" by messaging a firewall that
 * no longer existed. An enemy that walked onto it waited for an event that could never arrive.
 *
 * Why it pairs by DISTANCE rather than by reading the reference property. The reference is the thing
 * that is broken, so it is the least reliable evidence available: a null tells you nothing about
 * what it was supposed to point at, and a stale one may still name an actor that was deleted.
 * Position survives both. Two actors that were placed together are still where they were placed.
 *
 * The threshold is inferred rather than guessed, because the right distance depends entirely on the
 * level and a wrong constant either misses every orphan or reports every actor.
 *
 * It is inferred by looking for the GAP, not by taking a multiple of the median, and that difference
 * was settled by the level rather than by argument. A first version used five times the median; on
 * the real level the median pairing distance was 204 units and the actual orphan sat at 921, so the
 * threshold landed at 1019 and the check reported a clean level while the bug it was written for sat
 * right there. The synthetic fixture had passed, because a fixture author puts the orphan somewhere
 * obvious.
 *
 * Real pairs cluster, and a leftover is separated from that cluster by a jump. So the distances are
 * sorted and the largest proportional step between neighbours is found: if something is standing
 * well clear of the pack, the threshold goes in the gap. If the distances form one smooth run - a
 * level with no orphan - there is no such step and nothing is reported.
