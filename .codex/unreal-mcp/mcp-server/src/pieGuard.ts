/**
 * Compiling a Blueprint while the game is running crashes the editor.
 *
 * Measured, not theorised: changing one variable's replication flag on `BP_VirusData` - a replicated
 * actor with live instances in two PIE worlds - and calling `compile_blueprint` took UnrealEditor 5.6
 * down with `EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION` in `CoreUObject`, and the unsaved change went with it.
 *
 * Recompiling reinstances the class. The running worlds still hold objects of the old class, and the
 * engine does not protect the game thread from that. Replicated actors are the worst case because
 * every world holds instances, but nothing here is specific to replication.
 *
 * The failure is expensive in a way that argues for refusing rather than warning: the editor dies, so
 * the caller loses the edit AND every other unsaved change in the session, then pays a restart. A
 * warning in a reply is read after the fact.
 *
 * ## Why it always asks the editor
 *
 * The first version tracked whether this server had started PIE and only asked when it believed the
 * game was running - one saved round trip per compile. It was wrong in the direction that matters.
 * A person clicking Play in the editor starts a session this server never hears about, so the belief
 * is false exactly when the danger is real, and a guard that misses the crash it exists to prevent
 * is barely a guard.
 *
 * The round trip is also cheaper than it looks: the `pie_status` reply is consumed here and never
 * returned, so the caller pays no tokens for it, only about a tenth of a second against a compile
 * that already takes seconds. Latency was the wrong thing to optimise against a crash that loses the
 * whole session.
