/**
 * Turn a graph into a paragraph.
 *
 * Measured on a real 104-node EventGraph from an eight-month-old project: the structural summary
 * costs **8,838 tokens**. That is larger than the entire `lazy` tool payload, and larger than the
 * whole context a 14B has on a 12 GB card. Two thirds of it is not information — 30% is 32-character
 * node GUIDs and 36% is JSON key names repeated once per pin.
 *
 * So a model asking "what does this Blueprint do" cannot afford to ask, and that is the real answer
 * to "can it handle large Blueprints": not by reading them.
 *
 * This reads the structure once and returns what the structure MEANS: each entry point and the
 * ordered chain of things it does. It is the difference between handing someone a wiring diagram
 * and telling them what the machine is for. A weak model can act on the second and drowns in the
 * first.
 *
 * It is deliberately lossy. Anything that needs exact pins or ids still calls
 * `read_blueprint_graph_summary` — for one chain, not the whole graph.
