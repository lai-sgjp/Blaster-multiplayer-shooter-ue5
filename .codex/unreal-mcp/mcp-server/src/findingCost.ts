 * SEVERITY alone and, within "warning", by whatever order the graphs happened to be read in. On
 * BP_Player that put a cost-40 unhandled cast ahead of four cost-55 tick findings, in the one field

 * The ranking is the entire product of both tools. Having two of them rank differently is worse than

  // A cast to a GameMode fails on every client; a Get of a variable HOLDING one returns null on
  // every client. Nothing about the consequence differs, and the only reason this was not here is
  // that the check looked at Cast nodes and this project caches the reference in a variable
  // instead - ten Blueprints do. Scored lower, it would sort below findings that merely might
  // matter, which is how a defect with runtime proof ends up under a style warning.

  // High, and below the silent-breakage hundreds on purpose. The game still works - it just feels

  // asymmetry is what makes it expensive: it survives every test the person most likely to run one
  // can perform.
  "authority-gated-character-movement": 85,
  // A handle, not state. Deliberately far cheaper than the check above, because the commonest case
  // is not a bug at all: an object reference to an Actor that replicates itself. Costing it at 100
  // put correct code at the top of the audit, where a model acts on it first.

  // A state nothing leaves freezes the character in one pose for the rest of the round, and the
  // machine looks finished in the editor because the state IS wired - just not outward.

  // break what is there - the first copy still fires - it means a case the author added a
  // transition FOR is not handled, which shows up as "it doesn't switch out of aiming when I jump"
  // rather than as a frozen pose.
  // Low, and info severity, because nothing is broken right now. In this project all four spaced
  // names are self-consistent - the variable, its repNotify field and the handler graph all carry
  // the space - so the binding works. What it costs is the NEXT rename, the next search, and the
  // next person who types the name correctly and finds nothing. A trap, not a fault.

  // Was 90. Not because the check is wrong - an unhandled cast really does stop the chain silently -
  // but because 90 is the band reserved for "this WILL fail", and this check has no evidence of that.
  //
  // To be accurate about what was actually wrong: groups are ordered by cost alone, so 90 placed this
  // fifth overall rather than burying anything. What it did was put an idiom that appears 111 times
  // in a shipping game (measured, on 150 Blueprints, after the filtering ones are excluded)
  // immediately below "this cast fails on every client, every time" and "the parent's setup never
  // runs". A reader working down by severity met sixty-three graphs of mostly-fine casts fifth.
  //
  // The comparison that settles the number: cast-to-server-only-class is the SAME defect shape WITH
  // decisive evidence that it will fail, and it is 100. Without that evidence this is "might stop
  // silently, if it ever fails" - weaker than branch-dead-path (60), which never runs at all, and
  // about the strength of empty-event (40). So 40, beside it.
