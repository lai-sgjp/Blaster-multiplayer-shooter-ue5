/**
 * A record of everything this session changed.
 *
 * The complaint this answers is the one people raise about handing an AI direct control of an
 * engine: it introduces failure modes that do not exist when a human is clicking the buttons. The
 * human knows what they touched. The agent's user does not, and the user this project is aimed at
 * cannot read a Blueprint diff to find out.
 *
 * Undo already exists (every write lands in the editor's undo history under an "MCP:" prefix), but
 * undo is useless if you cannot see what there is to undo. So the server keeps a plain-language
 * log of every write it sent, which asset it targeted, and whether it worked - and will tell the
 * user on request, in an order that makes sense to someone who has never opened a Blueprint.
 *
 * Deliberately scoped: this records what THIS SERVER did. It is not an audit of the project, and
 * it does not claim to see edits made by a human in the editor or by another tool. That limit is
 * stated in the response rather than left for someone to discover.
 */

/** Commands that only read. Everything else is treated as a write, which is the safe default. */
/**
 * Every bridge command that changes nothing.
 *
 * `isWrite` is the negation of this set, which makes it a denylist: a command missing from here is
 * a write by default. That default was wrong 15 times. describe_class, find_broken_names,
 * get_game_settings, list_actors, list_data_table_rows, list_input_mappings,
 * list_material_parameters, list_variables, read_anim_blueprint, read_asset_properties,
 * read_behavior_tree, read_class_defaults, read_input_context, read_level_sequence and
 * read_niagara_system were all added to the bridge after this list was written, and every one of
 * them was being logged as a change to the project.
 *
 * What that cost: unreal_session_changes - the tool whose entire job is answering "what did I change
 * this session" - reported 359 writes across 190 assets after a session that made none. 9,871 tokens
 * of it. A model that calls it to check its own work gets a wall of false positives, which is worse
 * than the token cost: it is the one tool that has to be trustworthy about this.
 *
 * Each of these was read out of the C++ handler and confirmed to touch nothing, rather than trusted
 * because of its name. The direction of error matters here and is not symmetric: a read filed as a
 * write is noise, but a write filed as a read vanishes from the journal entirely, and the journal is
 * what the undo advice is built from. When unsure, leave it out.
 *
 * take_screenshot is deliberately NOT here. It touches no asset, but it does put a file on disk, and
 * a side effect that leaves something behind is worth one line in the log.
