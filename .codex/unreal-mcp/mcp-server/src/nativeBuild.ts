/**
 * Compile the project's C++, and report what broke in the same shape a Blueprint compile does.
 *
 * This closes the half of the C++ story that `find_source` opened. Locating a symbol lets a model
 * read and edit a .cpp; nothing let it find out whether the edit compiled. In a client with a shell
 * that is merely inconvenient - the model shells out to UnrealBuildTool and reads a wall of output.
 * In Claude Desktop, which has no shell, it is a hard stop: the model edits C++ and then guesses.
 * "Tell it a bug and it fixes it, whether it is C++ or Blueprints" is not true while one of those
 * two cannot be verified.
 *
 * Two decisions shape this.
 *
 * **Single-file by default.** UnrealBuildTool's `-SingleFile` compiles one translation unit and
 * skips linking: measured at 33 seconds against this plugin's own 6,900-line handler, where a full
 * editor build is minutes. It also sidesteps the problem that makes a naive "just build it" tool
 * useless here - a running editor holds the module DLL open, so the link step fails no matter how
 * correct the code is. The bridge lives INSIDE that editor, so it cannot be closed to satisfy the
 * build without killing the thing being asked. Compiling without linking answers "does my edit
 * compile" honestly and leaves the editor alone.
 *
 * **The output is parsed, not forwarded.** A UBT run emits megabytes; the answer is usually one line
 * of it. Forwarding the log would be the single most expensive reply this server has, which is the
 * failure this whole project exists to avoid.

 *
 * A project with C++ of its own defines its own editor target - `AntiVirusSquadEditor.Target.cs` in
 * `Source/`. Asking UnrealBuildTool to build `UnrealEditor` for that project puts BOTH targets in one
 * action graph, and each of them wants to link the project's plugin DLLs to the same paths. Two
 * actions producing one file is exactly what UBT refuses:
 *
 *   Action graph is invalid; unable to continue.
 *   Result: Failed (ActionGraphInvalid)
 *
 * Nothing in that says "wrong target". The two actions differ in one prerequisite - a shared PCH
 * under `Intermediate/Build/Win64/x64/UnrealEditor/` versus one under `.../AntiVirusSquadEditor/` -
 * and finding that meant diffing the two JSON files UBT writes on the way out.
 *
 * It survived because UBT caches a makefile: as long as one built by other means was valid, the
 * wrong target name never got as far as planning a graph. The first edit to any `.Build.cs`
 * invalidates that cache, and then every compile fails at once, for a reason that appears to have
 * nothing to do with the edit.
 *
 * The rule is the one the engine uses: a target is a `<Name>.Target.cs` under `Source/`, and the
 * editor one ends in `Editor`. A Blueprint-only project has no `Source/` at all and correctly gets
 * `UnrealEditor`, which is the engine's own editor and the thing such a project actually runs.
