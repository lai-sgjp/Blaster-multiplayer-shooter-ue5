 * model has the context to absorb `full` - that is why it is the in-process default - but "can
 * afford it" is not the same as "should pay it". It is 25k tokens of standing cost on every turn,
 * most of it describing tools the session will never call.
 *
 * Epic's own MCP plugin, shipped experimental in 5.8, hit the same wall and answered it the same
 * way: its Tool Search mode returns a few meta-tools from tools/list and lets the agent pull in the
 * rest on demand. That is a poor trade for a weak model, which struggles with the indirection -
 * which is exactly why `minimal` and `core` are untouched. It is an excellent trade for a capable
 * one, which will spend one call to buy back 24k tokens on every remaining turn.
 *
 * This comment used to end by dismissing "a generic call_tool proxy", on the grounds that enabling a
 * group hands over the REAL typed schemas while a proxy flattens everything into a stringly-typed
 * passthrough. The first half is still true and is why enable_tools remains the way to do real work.
 * The second half was wrong about the alternative rather than right about this design: Epic ships a
 * call_tool as well, and the reason is one this file had not measured. Enabling changes the
 * advertised tool list, that list sits ahead of everything else in the request, and changing it
 * invalidates the prompt cache for the whole conversation. For a tool used once, the "cheap" path
 * here was the most expensive call the server offered.
 *
 * So unreal_call_tool exists too, and it is not a flattened proxy: it validates against the same
 * strict schema the tool advertises. Both paths, honestly priced - see DEFERRAL_TOOLS below.

 * Reject a parameter this tool does not have, instead of ignoring it.
 *
 * zod strips unknown keys by default, so a plausible-but-wrong parameter name was accepted in
 * silence and the tool ran unfiltered. Measured on the real project:
 *
 *   unreal_list_blueprints { match: "ServerList" }          75 tokens, one Blueprint
 *   unreal_list_blueprints { nameContains: "ServerList" }  4014 tokens, all 339
 *
 * 53x the cost for one wrong word, with nothing in the reply to say the filter did nothing - so the
 * caller may also go on to reason about "the Blueprints matching ServerList" and be wrong about all
 * 339 of them. Both halves of that are bad, and the second is worse.
 *
 * The names are not guessable and there is no reason they should be: `match`, `nameContains`,
 * `filter`, `contains` and `query` are all equally reasonable things to try. So the answer is the
 * one this repo already gives for a wrong pin name - refuse it, and say what does exist. The list is
 * captured at registration, so it cannot drift from the schema it came from.

/**
 * Calling a tool without switching it on.
 *
 * Epic's own MCP plugin ships exactly this shape - list_toolsets, describe_toolset, call_tool - and
 * reading their docs is what exposed the hole here. This server had the listing and the enabling
 * and no way to just USE something, so every one-off tool call cost a tool-list change, and a
 * tool-list change costs the whole prompt cache. That is the opposite of the goal.
 *
 * The two paths are not redundant and neither replaces the other:
 *
 *   enable_tools  - one cache invalidation, then the schema is visible for the rest of the session.
 *                   Right for a tool used repeatedly, and right when the model needs the schema in
 *                   front of it to sequence a job correctly.
 *   call_tool     - no tool-list change at all, so the cache survives. Right for the long tail: the
 *                   single save, the one compile, the status check at the end of a job in a group
 *                   nothing else needs.
 *
 * The trap to avoid is a dispatcher that guesses. It validates against the SAME strict schema the
 * tool advertises, so a bad argument is refused here exactly as it would be if the tool were on -
 * two ways to call one thing that disagree about its arguments is the defect class this project
 * keeps finding, and it will not be introduced on purpose.
