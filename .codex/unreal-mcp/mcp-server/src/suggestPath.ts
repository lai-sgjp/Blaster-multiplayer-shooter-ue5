/**
 * "Did you mean ...?" for a Blueprint or asset path that does not exist.
 *
 * Guessing a path is the most common way a call fails, and it is the one failure the server can
 * simply look up the answer to. Measured on this project, twice in three calls while doing ordinary
 * work: `/Game/Blueprints/Characters/BP_Player` and `/Game/AntiVirusSquad/_Core/GameModes/GM_Gameplay`
 * were both wrong, and both had a real asset one lookup away.
 *
 * What that costs without this:
 *
 *   failed call      147 tokens   (the not-found error, which is long because it teaches the fix)
 *   list_blueprints  104 tokens   (the lookup the error tells you to do)
 *   the real call     21 tokens
 *
 * Three round trips, and the two wasted ones are the expensive part - every round trip re-reads the
 * whole conversation. With the suggestion attached the model has the real path in hand after the
 * first failure, so the same work is two calls, and the second one succeeds.
 *
 * The suggestion is appended to the error the bridge already wrote rather than replacing it. That
 * error explains the path-repeats-the-name rule and the create-it-first case, neither of which a
 * name match can answer, and an error that gets shorter when it gets smarter is a bad trade.
 *
 * ONLY A REAL MATCH IS OFFERED. "Did you mean X?" about an unrelated asset is a confident falsehood
 * in the one place a model is already confused, which is worse than saying nothing - it would send
 * it down a second wrong path with more conviction than the first. So the leaf name has to actually
 * appear in the candidate's name, and when nothing matches this returns undefined and the original
 * error stands alone.
