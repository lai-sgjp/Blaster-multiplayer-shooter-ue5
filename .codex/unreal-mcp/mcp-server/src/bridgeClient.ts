 * Name the modal dialog that is blocking the editor, when there is one and the platform will say.

 * hand, which is exactly the kind of half hour this file exists to prevent.
 *
 * It does not catch every case, and saying so matters more than the feature does. A save prompt
 * raised from inside the editor (InternalPromptForCheckoutAndSave, which is what blocks when
 * something tries to save an Engine template map) leaves the main window title unchanged, and this
 * returns null for it. So a null here means "no dialog owns the main window", NOT "no dialog is
 * open" - which is why the generic line is still printed when this finds nothing.
 *
 * Best effort in every direction: only on win32, only on a path that has already spent its whole
