/**
 * Keep a level listing inside a budget, and make the default reply answer a question worth asking.
 *
 * Measured on a real level rather than reasoned about: 889 actors returned 26,698 tokens, of which
 * 42% was JSON keys and punctuation. But the more interesting number is the per-class census in the
 * same reply - it describes the WHOLE level in 193 tokens. The tool's own description already said
 * the census exists "so a large level is legible without listing all of it", and then it listed 200
 * of them anyway. The dump was not answering a question; it was the absence of one.
 *
 * So the default is no longer a dump. Unfiltered, this returns the census plus the actors that carry
 * logic, and says how to ask for the rest. Filtered, it returns the actors, because at that point
 * the caller has asked something specific and deserves a real answer.
 *
 * Two things were checked and deliberately NOT done, because measuring said so:
 *
 * - Dropping `label` as derivable from `name`. It is not: only 12 of 889 actors matched, because
 *   UE's label counter and name counter disagree ("Brush0" is "Brush_0", "PlayerStart2" is
 *   "PlayerStart_1"). It looked redundant on the sample I first eyeballed and was not.
 * - Flattening each actor to one delimited line, the way graph pins were flattened. Pins read
 *   naturally as a sentence; an actor is four heterogeneous fields where position is the only clue
 *   to which is the label and which is the name, and getting that backwards renames the wrong actor.
 *
 * As with the graph cap, this is applied in the TOOL and not the bridge, so anything analysing a
 * level still sees every actor.

 * they correspond to. The same path is written out for every actor of its kind.
 *
 * Note which half this lifts. The comment below records dropping `class` and keeping `blueprint`
 * being implemented, measured and reverted: it saved 38 tokens and cost the field everybody
 * identifies an actor by. This is the other direction. `class` stays on every row - it is what
 * `classFilter` matches and what a test asserts on - and the expensive half moves to a map keyed by
 * it. About 437 tokens on a 2,392-token reply, and the lookup a caller does is on a value the row
 * already carries.
 *
 * The 1:1 relation is CHECKED, not assumed. Two Blueprints in different folders can both generate a
 * class called `BP_Thing_C`, and then the class does not identify the path. Any class with more than
 * one path keeps `blueprint` on its rows, so the map never claims something it cannot support.

 * measured, and reverted, because both halves of the trade turned out to be worse than they looked.
 *

 *
 * The cost is that `class` is how anybody identifies an actor here. `classFilter` is a parameter of
 * this very tool, and the test guarding the rare-Blueprint cap asks `a.class === "BP_Boss_C"` -
 * which is the obvious way to write it. Making a caller parse a path to recover something the row
 * used to state is a bad trade at any price, and at 38 tokens it is not a trade at all.
 *
 * Kept as a comment because the idea looks good until it is measured, and the next person to have it
