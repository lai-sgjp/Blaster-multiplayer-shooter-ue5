/**
 * Variables marked Replicated on an Actor that does not replicate.
 *
 * Ticking "Replicated" on a variable does nothing unless the Actor itself replicates. The editor
 * lets you do both independently, shows no warning, and the variable keeps its little replication
 * icon - so the Blueprint reads as networked and is not. Every value stays local to whichever
 * machine changed it, which looks correct to whoever is hosting and to anyone testing alone.
 *
 * Measured on a real project: 19 Blueprints declare at least one replicated variable and two of them
 * do not replicate.
 *
 *   BP_PlaceableBase   parent Actor                 bReplicates false   4 replicated variables
 *   BP_Turret          parent BP_PlaceableBase_C    bReplicates false   9 replicated variables
 *
 * Thirteen variables that cannot reach a client, and the second Blueprint inherits the flag from the
 * first - so the fix is one checkbox on the base, not two.
 *
 * ## Why this is not noisy
 *
 * There is no reading in which it is intentional. A variable is marked Replicated to send it
 * somewhere; an Actor that does not replicate sends nothing. Unlike an unhandled cast or a long
 * chain, the two settings contradict each other inside one asset, which is the same standard the
 * GameMode pawn check is held to.
 *
 * The controls matter as much as the finding: BP_Player and BP_FireWall both replicate and both
 * declare replicated variables, and BP_FireWall's parent is a plain Actor - so this is not simply
 * flagging everything whose parent is Actor.
