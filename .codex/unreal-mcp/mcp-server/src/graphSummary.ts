/**
 * Keep a graph summary inside a budget a model can actually afford.
 *
 * Measured against a real game rather than reasoned about: BP_Player's EventGraph is 807 nodes, and
 * reading it returned 126,477 tokens - 63% of a 200k context window, in a single call, from a
 * project whose stated premise is that the model should never receive a raw engine dump. Every
 * saving made on tool definitions is rounding error beside one call like that.
 *
 * Two things make the cap safe rather than lossy.
 *
 * First, it is applied in the TOOL and not in the bridge. review, audit and explainGraph all call
 * the bridge command directly and still receive every node, so the analysis stays correct while the
 * model gets a view it can afford. Capping in the bridge would have quietly corrupted those instead
 * - which is exactly the mistake explainGraph's own traversal cap had already made once, reporting
 * live nodes as dead.
 *
 * Second, entry points are never dropped. They are where reading a graph starts, and a cap that
 * removes them leaves the remainder unreadable - a list of function calls belonging to nothing.
 *
 * The honest framing for a caller: a truncated summary is not a smaller answer to the same question,
 * it is an answer to "show me around". When the question is specific, `match` answers it for a
 * fiftieth of the cost, and explain_graph answers "what does this DO" without listing nodes at all.
