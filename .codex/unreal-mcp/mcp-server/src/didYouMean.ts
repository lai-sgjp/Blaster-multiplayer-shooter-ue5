/**
 * Re-ranking the bridge's near-miss suggestions, and dropping the ones that are not near misses.
 *
 * The plugin answers a name it cannot resolve with a `didYouMean` list, which is the most useful
 * self-correction signal in the system. It ranks by shared prefix, and measured against a live
 * editor that produces answers that are actively worse than none:
 *
 *   SpawnActor                  -> Spawn (a ThirdParty tutorial conveyor Blueprint)
 *                                  Spawn (UMG.Viewport)
 *                                  SpawnActorFromClass          <- the right answer, ranked third
 *   ApplyRootMotionRadialForce  -> Apply (VariantManagerBlueprintLibrary)
 *
 * `SpawnActorFromClass` is what the caller wanted and it sits behind two unrelated five-letter
 * functions that happen to start with the same five letters. `Apply` shares five characters out of
 * twenty-six and is not a near miss by any reading; offering it to somebody who is already lost is
 * the confident-falsehood failure this project keeps finding, wearing the costume of helpfulness.
 *
 * ## Containment beats prefix
 *
 * The rule that fixes both cases is that a candidate CONTAINING what was asked for is a better
 * answer than one that merely starts the same way. `SpawnActorFromClass` contains `SpawnActor`;
 * `Spawn` does not. Among containing candidates the shortest wins, because it is the least
 * embellished version of the thing asked for.
 *
 * ## Silence is a valid answer
 *
 * When nothing scores well enough the list is emptied and the bridge's error stands on its own.
 * That is the point rather than a shortfall: `unreal_find_node` does proper word matching and is
 * one call away, and sending a caller to `Apply` costs a round trip AND the credibility of every
 * other suggestion this system makes.
 *
 * Done here rather than in the C++ that generates the list, for the reason engineTypes.ts records
 * about the same choice: the resolver would be the tidier place and only reaches somebody who has
 * rebuilt their plugin, while this layer reaches everyone now.
