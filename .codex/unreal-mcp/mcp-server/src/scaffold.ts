/**
 * A whole Blueprint in one call.
 *
 * Benchmarking said this plainly: both a 7B and a 14B fail the same four-step task in the same way.
 * They complete step one, declare the task finished, and then repeat their first successful call
 * even when told exactly what is missing. Doubling the parameters changed nothing, so it is not a
 * capacity problem — it is that a small model cannot hold a plan across turns.
 *
 * You cannot fix that from inside a tool. What you can do is stop requiring it. If the failure is
 * "cannot reliably make four calls in sequence", then the answer is a call that does all four, and
 * a model that manages exactly one successful tool call finishes a whole feature.
 *
 * That is the entire justification for this being one big call rather than a tidy set of small
 * ones. Everything here is available separately; this is the same work with the sequencing moved
 * from the model, which is bad at it, to the server, which cannot get it wrong.
 *
 * Order matters and is fixed deliberately: variables and components exist before any graph
 * references them, handlers are built after that, and the compile happens once at the end rather
 * than after every step.
