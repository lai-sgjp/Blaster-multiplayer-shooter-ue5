/**
 * Understanding a system that already exists, across the Blueprints it is spread over.
 *
 * This is the problem people actually have with an eight-month-old project: one Blueprint is wired
 * to five others, and there is no way to explain that to a model. Chat without tools cannot be told
 * the context. Tools that only read one asset at a time make the model reconstruct the shape by
 * hand, one expensive read at a time, and it usually gives up and edits the first file it found -
 * which is how an agent breaks a working project.
 *
 * So this answers the question directly: given a concept ("health", "inventory", "the vacuum"),
 * which assets make up that system, how are they connected, and in what order should they be read.
 *
 * The whole thing is built from cheap reads - the project index and the asset dependency graph -
 * and never opens a graph. A map of a twenty-asset system costs a fraction of reading one large
 * Blueprint, which is the point: the map is what you look at BEFORE deciding what to read.

 * Does `identifier` contain `concept` as a WORD, rather than inside one?

 *
 *   "bar" already exists in this project: BP_DummyTurret, BP_MomBase, BP_Turret and 9 more.
 *
 * BP_DummyTurret is there because it has a variable called `TurretBarrelLoc`. That claim goes into
 * `raiseWithUser`, the field whose whole purpose is to stop a model and make it ask - so a false
 * one buys a pointless question, or worse, a refusal to build something the project does not have.
 *
 * Identifiers here are camelCase or snake_case, so the word boundaries are real and findable:
 * `TurretBarrelLoc` is Turret / Barrel / Loc, and none of those is "bar". `WBP_DataBar`,
 * `UpdateHealBar` and `EnergyRadialBar` all are, and all of them are genuine - this project really
 * does have bars.
 *
 * A derived form counts, and getting that wrong is the opposite failure. `GetVacuumable` IS part of
 * the vacuum system, and `BPI_Damageable` is how half of Unreal names an interface - a rule strict
 * enough to reject `Barrel` must still accept those. The distinguishing fact is not prefix-ness,
 * since "bar" is a prefix of "barrel" exactly as "vacuum" is a prefix of "vacuumable": it is that
 * `-able` is a suffix English actually uses to build a word from another, and `-rel` is not.
 *
 * So a word matches when it IS the concept, or the concept plus one of those suffixes. That first
 * version - concept, or concept + s/es - was caught by an existing test whose fixture contained
 * `GetVacuumable`, which is exactly the kind of name this must not lose.
