/**
 * Two ways a project sends state to the client and then fails to use it.
 *
 * Both came out of one firewall in a real game, and both are invisible to single-machine testing
 * for the same reason: on a listen server the host IS the server, so everything works on the
 * machine the developer is looking at.
 *
 * ## 1. A server event that touches the UI
 *
 * A widget exists only on the machine that created it. A Server RPC that updates a widget therefore
 * updates the host's screen and nobody else's - and it reads as perfectly reasonable code, because
 * the widget reference is valid, the cast succeeds, and there is no error anywhere.
 *
 * The real one: a repair timer running on the server pushed the progress ring straight into the
 * widget. The host's ring filled. Everybody else watched a wall repair itself with a frozen bar.
 *
 * ## 2. A RepNotify with an empty body
 *
 * Marking a variable RepNotify says "the clients need to react when this arrives". An empty OnRep
 * says nobody wrote the reaction. The value is being sent across the network, on every change, for
 * nothing.
 *
 * It is worth its own check because it is evidence of *intent*: somebody knew the client had to
 * respond here. Finding one usually means finding the missing half of a feature, and it is almost
 * always the half that makes the game work for people who are not hosting.
