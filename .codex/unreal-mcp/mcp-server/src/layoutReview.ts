/**
 * Is this graph laid out like a person laid it out?
 *
 * A model can add correct nodes and leave a graph that reads as scrambled wire, and nothing in this
 * tool noticed. It took a human opening BP_Player to say so: *"it's like taking headphones and you
 * scramble the wires... if someone looks at this, it's gonna be like, this is AI, bro."* Sixty nodes
 * had gone in at invented coordinates, across four regions, overlapping 154 of his own nodes.
 *
 * Correctness was never the problem - it compiled, it ran. The problem is that disorderly work costs
 * the person who has to edit it next, and no amount of "remember to be tidy" survives the moment a
 * feature does not work yet and tidiness feels postponable.
 *
 * So the conventions are checked instead of remembered. Every rule here came from measuring a graph
 * a person maintains by hand, not from taste:
 *
 *   - **Flow runs rightward.** His 369 execution wires had 0 running backwards; the ones added by a
 *     model had 4. Those counts read 306 and 44 until this file learned that a Branch's second exec
 *     output is called "else" - about a fifth of every graph's execution wiring was invisible, and
 *     the four backward wires in the generated system had been hiding in it the whole time.
 *     Epic's own guidance is "align wires, not nodes" - you cannot control pin
 *     positions, but you can place nodes so the wire has a straight run. A chain that jumps left
 *     makes the reader backtrack, and enough of those is what spaghetti is.
 *   - **Nothing is stacked.** Two nodes at the same coordinates are invisible until one is dragged.
 *   - **Every system is in a comment box.** In his graphs each system - Vaccum, Inputs, Healing,
 *     Spawn Ping - sits in a titled box, and the prose lives on the box. A loose node belongs to
 *     nothing, and in the editor a box OWNS what is inside it, so a node outside the box is left
 *     behind when the box is moved.
 *   - **Wires stay short.** "A human never runs a wire across the whole canvas."
 *
 * Data wires are deliberately not direction-checked. A Get feeding a node from below and slightly
 * left is normal and correct; only execution order is reading order.
 */

/**
 * Which of these checks have ever fired on real code?
 *
 * Every kind below has a unit test asserting it fires on synthetic nodes. That proves the code path
 * works; it does not prove the rule describes anything real, and this file has already had to remove
 * two rules that only ever fired on fixtures. So the kinds were counted across all 92 Blueprint
 * EventGraphs in the project they were written for, after a day of fixing what they found:
 *
 *   unboxed            48    the workhorse - most of what is left to do in a graph
 *   longWire           14
 *   overlappingBoxes    3    all in one hand-authored graph
 *   emptyBox            3    two are real leftovers, one is a redirector counting a graph twice
 *   backwardFlow        1
 *   stacked             0    fired once, on an invisible node pair, and was fixed
 *   startsMidChain      0    0 of 92 now; fires on an older snapshot of the same Blueprint
 *   untitledBox         0    never seen on real code here
 *   machineLaidOut      0    never seen on real code here
 *   notJudged           0    for animation graphs, which this sweep did not include
 *
 * A zero is not a reason to delete a check. stacked and startsMidChain both earned their place by
 * catching a real fault and then reading zero once it was fixed, which is what a working guard looks
 * like. But untitledBox and machineLaidOut are held to fixtures alone, and a rule with no real
 * example is the exact shape of the two that had to be withdrawn - so a change to either should be
 * measured against a project before it is trusted, not reasoned about.

  // nothing boxed, and that is knowable. Measured, it took the project from 85 clean graphs to 3
  // and flagged BP_TestTarget, which has two nodes. It is wrong for the same reason every other
  // over-eager rule here was: this project's own convention is 54% of nodes in a box, and its
  // author leaves 30-to-60-node widget and anim graphs unboxed on purpose. Reporting those imposes
  // a rule the standard does not follow.
  //
  // The real complaint - that a boxless graph read as "clean" - is a reporting problem, and belongs
  // in the sweep's clean count rather than in the findings. Single-graph review already says
  // "there is no comment box in scope" instead of claiming everything is boxed.  //
  // Measured again on FUNCTION graphs, because a 20-node BP_Player function with no box at all
  // reporting "clean" looked like the check quietly skipping them. It is not skipping them -
  // K2Node_FunctionEntry is an entry type and boxed functions do get findings. Boxing inside a
  // function simply starts at a size:
  //
  //   with boxes:    GetVacuumableObject 83, BackpackMaterialVelocity 28, stickDriftFix 28,
  //                  CheckPlayersData 26, VaccumObjects 24, VacuumEnergyDrain 16

  //                  GetSensitivity 21, VacuumPush 20, and twenty more
  //
  // So the threshold is about 24 nodes, and it makes sense: a function is ALREADY a named unit, so
  // a box round the whole of a small one explains nothing the title does not.
  //
  // That threshold still does not rescue a rule, which is why none is written. The graphs left
  // unboxed on purpose above include 30-to-60-node widget and anim graphs, so "24 or more nodes and
  // no box" would accuse them too. The number is worth recording, not shipping.

  // draws a rectangle round some nodes while explaining nothing about them.
  // --- a titled box with nothing in it ---
  //
  // Found by accident and then measured: 17 of this project's 377 boxes hold nothing at all, and
  // ELEVEN of those are in one graph - the same graph the sweep flags as the outlier at wire p90
  // 2840. That graph has 63 of its 206 nodes at x=0 and only 21 distinct x values across a 6928-unit
  // span, which is column-grid output from an automatic layout, not a hand-built graph.
  //
  // So the boxes are not decoration somebody forgot to fill. A relayout moved the nodes and left the
  // boxes where they were, and "Countdown", "Win Screen" and "Begin Play" now name empty rectangles
  // while the code they described sits elsewhere. That is the box-ownership problem at full scale,
  // and it is invisible to every other check here: the nodes are fine, the boxes are fine, and the
  // relationship between them is gone.
  //
  // A box holding only other boxes is NOT empty - that is the nesting convention, an outer box whose
  // parts each have their own.
  //
  // VERTICAL SPRAWL is not checked either - measured and rejected, and this one looked strong going
  // in. Systems in this project are almost flat: the median exec chain spans 48 units top to bottom
  // in BP_Player and 80 in BP_FireWall, so a chain 688 tall stands out by a factor of fourteen.
  //
  // It stands out because it BRANCHES. Every system in either graph spanning 300 or more contains at
  // least one Branch, and the spread tracks how many: one Branch gives about 400, two give 304,
  // three give 688. A Branch has two exec outputs and they have to go somewhere - one up, one down.
  // Flagging the spread would flag the branching, and telling someone their Branch should be flatter
  // is telling them to draw worse wires.
  //
  // Width is not a substitute either: KillPlayer runs 5216 across at 448 tall, which is a long chain
  // wrapping once, and reads fine.
  //
  // A box holding MORE THAN ONE system is also not checked, measured and rejected the same way. It
  // looked like the obvious missing rule: a comment box captures by overlap, so a box straddling two
  // systems drags foreign nodes when it moves. But 16 of BP_Player's 65 leaf boxes hold several
  // entry events, and every one of them is deliberate - "Aim Server" holds BeginAim and EndAim,
  // "Start/End Vaccum" holds both halves by name, "Regeneration Cooldowns" holds HealthRegen and
  // EnergyRegen. A box is drawn round a FEATURE, and a feature has a beginning and an end, or a
  // server half and a client half. The rule would have accused a quarter of the correctly-organised
  // boxes in the largest graph here, which is the same failure as the aspect-ratio rule.
  //
  // A DUPLICATE box title is deliberately not checked, having been measured and rejected. Seven
  // exist across three graphs, and none is a fault: WB_ShopSlot's three pairs are each offset by
  // exactly +1296, a copied UI block, and BP_Player's "Vaccum"/"Vacuum Push" pairs are separate
  // populated systems that happen to share a name. Emptiness is the signal that actually separates
  // leftover from real - the one duplicate worth removing was empty, and this check already had it.
