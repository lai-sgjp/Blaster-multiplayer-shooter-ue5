 * Check a feature request against the project that already exists, before building anything.

 * "add a stamina system", and before touching anything they come back with "you already have a
 * stamina variable on BP_Player and a HUD bar reading it - do you want me to extend that, or did
 * you mean something else?". That one exchange is worth more than any amount of generated graph,
 * because the alternative is a second stamina system quietly competing with the first.
 *
 * A model cannot do that from a chat window: it does not know what is in the project. This closes
 * that gap using only index reads, so the check costs a fraction of one Blueprint read and there is
 * no excuse to skip it.
 *
 * What this does NOT do is design the feature. Judgement is the model's job. This supplies the
 * facts the model cannot otherwise have: what exists, what it would collide with, what the project's
 * own conventions are, and which questions are worth asking a human before starting.

 * "enemies" -> "enemy", not "enemie".
 *
 * The old rule dropped a trailing "s", and the difference is not cosmetic. Asked to "make enemies
 * drop loot when they die", plan_feature examined the concept **enemie** - and on a real project
 * that finds a different system entirely:
 *
 *   enemie   BP_WaveSystem, BP_DummyTurret, GM_TutGameplay, BP_BaseCharacter, ...
 *   enemy    BP_BaseEnemy, BP_EnemyController, BP_FlyingEnemy, BPI_Enemy, BPI_EnemyInteractable
 *
 * The first list is spawner bookkeeping - assets with a variable called something like
 * `RemainingEnemies`. The second is the enemy system. For a request whose subject is enemies, the
 * plan was reading the wrong half of the project, and `BP_FlyingEnemy`, `BPI_Enemy` and
 * `BP_EnemyController` never appeared at all.
 *
 * Deliberately three rules and no more. A real stemmer would turn "sprinting" into "sprint" and
 * "regenerates" into "regener", and the second is worse than the word it replaced - this only has to
 * undo the plural a person types when they describe a feature.
