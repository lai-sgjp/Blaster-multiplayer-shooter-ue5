 * Where do nodes go when the graph is too big to lay out?

 * larger change than the one being asked for. But skipping the layout left the new nodes wherever
 * the engine defaulted them, which is the origin.
 *
 * Measured, after the guidance had been corrected to say "omit x/y and each node is placed beside
 * what it connects to": three nodes built with no coordinates all arrived at (0,0), stacked on each
 * other and on top of a node called UpdateLocalVanPing. So on a large graph BOTH options were wrong -
 * passing coordinates lands on somebody's system, and omitting them lands on the origin, which is
 * usually somebody's system too.
 *
 * This closes that. New nodes are placed relative to whatever they connect to, and a batch that
 * connects to nothing is put in clear canvas below everything rather than at the origin. Nothing
 * that already existed is moved.
