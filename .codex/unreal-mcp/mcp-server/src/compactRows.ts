 * A list of rows from the engine repeats the same keys once per row, and most of the values are the
 * default. Measured on a real Blueprint, BP_Player's 84 variables: 65% of the reply was structure
 * rather than data, and four boolean flags accounted for most of it -
 *
 *     isArray            83/84 false
 *     instanceEditable   81/84 false
 *     blueprintReadOnly  84/84 false
 *     replicated         69/84 false
 *
 * `blueprintReadOnly` was emitted eighty-four times to report nothing at all. Dropping the false
 * ones saves 1,791 tokens of 4,084 - 44% of the reply - without removing a single fact, because
 * absent and false are the same statement once the convention is stated.
 *
 * That last clause is the whole risk, and it is why the tools using this say so in their
 * descriptions. A model that reads a missing flag as "unknown" rather than "false" would go and ask
 * again, which costs more than the field ever did.
 *
 * As everywhere else in this server, this is applied in the TOOL layer. review and audit call the
 * bridge directly and still receive every field - which matters here more than usual, because the
 * replication checks in review are driven by exactly the flags this drops.
