/**
 * Auditing a whole project, ranked by what a finding is likely to cost.
 *
 * Every other tool here answers a question about one Blueprint. That is the right shape for an
 * agent mid-task and the wrong shape for the question people actually arrive with:
 *
 *   "My game has bugs and a deadline. Where do I look?"
 *
 * This existed as a script first, which meant the model could not run it - the single most useful
 * thing in the project was available to a person at a terminal and to nobody else. It lives here so
 * both can use it.
 *
 * ## Ordering
 *
 * By likely cost, not by severity, and the two are not the same. A dead event is cosmetic until
 * someone wires it. A cast that fails on every client but the host is a bug report nobody can
 * reproduce alone, which is exactly how it survives to a showcase. The order below is the order to
 * work in with a limited afternoon.
 *
 * ## Cost of running it
 *
 * It reads what an agent would read anyway - the project index and one graph summary per graph -
 * so the bridge cost is bounded and predictable. The RESULT is deliberately small: counts, the
 * ranked groups, and a handful of examples each. A ranked list of eight hundred findings is the
 * same as no list.
