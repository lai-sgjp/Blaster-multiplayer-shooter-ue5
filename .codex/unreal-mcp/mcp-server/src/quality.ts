/**
 * Blueprint quality review.
 *
 * The premise of this file: a weak model does not fail because it lacks capability, it fails
 * because it has no feedback. It writes a graph, nothing objects, and it declares victory. A
 * strong model has the same problem in a smaller way. Compilation is the only signal either of
 * them gets, and compilation is a very low bar: a graph full of dead nodes, unhandled cast
 * failures, and leftover debug prints compiles perfectly.
 *
 * So this is the missing signal. Every check below is something a senior Unreal developer would
 * actually flag in review, computed from a single cheap graph read, and reported with the exact
 * fix. A model that runs it can self-correct; a model that never runs it still gets the findings,
 * because unreal_build_graph attaches them to its own result.
 *
 * Every check is deliberately conservative. A false positive teaches a model to distrust the
 * whole report, which is worse than a missed finding.

  // nearly every graph anyone has ever written. Measured across this project: 344 findings out of
  // 834, so FORTY-ONE PERCENT of everything the audit said was this one info-level note about
  // comment boxes - more than every multiplayer, replication and dead-logic check combined.
  //
  // That is the failure this file already names twice: a check that fires on ordinary correct
  // practice is noise, and noise is how a report stops being read. A seven-node function with two
  // chains and no comment box is not hard to read; it is a seven-node function.
  //
  // What the finding actually claims is that a reader cannot see the structure without tracing
  // wires. That is a property of SIZE, so it is now gated on size: a big graph, several distinct
  // chains, and no labelling at all. A graph that has made any attempt to label itself is left
  // alone, because "you have four boxes and five chains" is advice nobody needs.
  //
  // Deliberately not raised to a warning. It has no runtime consequence, and the one piece of
  // direct human feedback this project has on the subject is that machine-added comment boxes were
  // too big and too many - so this should nudge at the extreme and stay quiet everywhere else.
