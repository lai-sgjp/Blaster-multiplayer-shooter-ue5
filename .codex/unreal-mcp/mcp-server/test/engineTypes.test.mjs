/**
 * Found by asking what a model would naturally send, rather than by reading the code.
 * unreal_add_variable accepts 20 of 26 obvious spellings - int, int32, integer, bool, boolean,
 * Float, String all work - and refused exactly six:
 *
 *   FString  FText  FName  FVector  FRotator   (and a bare asset class name)
 *
 * Those five are not typos. They are how Unreal itself spells them, and they are what a model has in
 * front of it after unreal_find_source hands back a header. The join that broke is C++ to Blueprint:
 * read a native class, go to declare a matching variable, spell the type the way the source spells
 * it, and get refused.
