// Without it they use the default 8765, and if an editor happens to be running they reach it. That
// is not merely impure, it is slow in the worst way: an editor whose game thread is BLOCKED accepts
// the connection and never answers, so every bridge-touching test waits the full timeout. Measured
// with one blocked editor open, three tests took 181 seconds each and the suite went from 17 seconds
// to six minutes - which then pushed the pre-push hook past its limit.
//
// A refused connection is instant and deterministic, and these tests are about what the SERVER does
// with a request, not what an editor answers. The trial and live-verify scripts deliberately do the
// opposite: they take the default because reaching the editor is their entire point.
