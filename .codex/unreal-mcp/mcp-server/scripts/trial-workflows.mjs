//   "upgrades aren't showing up in the shop"           -> find the bug

// could re-run - and the routing they depend on is a keyword table, the single most fragile thing
// here. A rename, a reordered entry, or a word dropped from a `says` list breaks a journey without
// breaking a unit test.
//
// It reports CALLS and TOKENS per journey as well as pass/fail, because "did it still work" and
// "did it get more expensive" are different regressions and only the first one throws.
//
// Journeys 1 and 2 are read-only against the real project. Journey 3 has to write, so it builds its
// own table in the scratch namespace and deletes it, rather than touching anything a person made.
