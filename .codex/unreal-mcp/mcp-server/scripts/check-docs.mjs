// Documentation guard.
//
// Every other check in this repo watches the code: tool parity, unit tests, live verification, the
// crash sweep. None of them look at prose, and that gap has already cost something real - a slice
// replacement between two headings silently deleted 67 lines of README (the live-verification and
// crash-sweep sections) and every automated check still passed. It surfaced only by luck, when a
// later edit anchored on a heading that no longer existed.
//
// Docs are not decoration in this project. A capability nobody can find is unshipped, and a
// document that claims a tool exists when it does not is worse than silence, because someone will
// act on it. So the same standard applies to prose as to code: if it can rot silently, guard it.
//
// Checks:
//   1. every registered tool is documented in mcp-server/README.md
//   2. every tool the docs mention actually exists
//   3. required README sections are present (catches deletion, which is the failure that happened)
//   4. the complaint matrix uses only its declared statuses
//   5. the complaint matrix does not reference tools that do not exist
//
// Run: npm run check:docs  (also part of npm test)

  // list five headings that do not exist. A documentation check tripped by documentation, and the
  // same "matched a mention rather than a use" mistake this repo keeps making in other files.
