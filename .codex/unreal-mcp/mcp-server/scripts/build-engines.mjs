// Sync the plugin source into every target project and build it against every engine.
//
// This plugin supports two engine versions, and the routine that keeps them honest was, until now,
// a human remembering to do the second one. That failed three times, each time producing a failure
// that looked like broken code and was really a binary older than the change.
//
// So it is one command, and it refuses to report success unless every target actually built. A
// partial success reported as success is the whole problem restated.
//
// Targets live in build-targets.json next to this script, because engine and project paths are
// specific to a machine and hardcoding them here would make this script a lie on anyone else's.
//
// Two modes, because they catch different mistakes:
//
//   (default)    sync the source into each target project and build its editor target. This is what
//                actually happens to a user, and it is the only mode that leaves usable binaries.
//   --isolated   RunUAT BuildPlugin instead. Compiles against PUBLIC engine APIs only, needs no
//                configured project, and does not drag in the host project's other plugins - the
//                real game project used here cannot build its editor target at all, because a Wwise
//                plugin references an AkAudio module that is not installed. Building the whole
//                project would let that unrelated failure mask this plugin's own result.
