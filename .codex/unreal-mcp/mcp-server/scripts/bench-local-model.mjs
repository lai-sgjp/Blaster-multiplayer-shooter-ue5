// Drive this MCP server with a LOCAL model, and measure how well it copes.
//
// The project's headline claim is that it works "no matter how dumb or smart the model is". That
// claim has been argued for, designed for, and never tested. A frontier model succeeding proves
// nothing about it; the interesting question is whether a 7B running on a consumer GPU can take a
// plain-English request and produce a working Blueprint.
//
// This is a real agent loop, not a mock: it hands the model the actual tool schemas from the
// running MCP server, parses its tool calls, executes them, feeds the results back, and repeats.
// What it measures is what matters for a cheap model:
//
//   - tokens per second, so "cheap" can be stated in seconds rather than adjectives
//   - how many tool calls were malformed (bad JSON, missing required params, invented tool names)
//   - how many failed against the bridge, and whether the model recovered from the error text
//   - whether the task actually got done, checked against the project rather than the transcript
//
// Usage:
//   node scripts/bench-local-model.mjs --model qwen2.5-coder:7b [--task health] [--steps 20]
//
// Requires: Ollama running, and an Unreal Editor open with the plugin.
