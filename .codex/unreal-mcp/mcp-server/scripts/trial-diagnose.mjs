// Plant a defect, then check the diagnostic tools actually FIND it.
//
// trial-feature walks the authoring loop: build a thing and check it works. This walks the other
// loop, and it is the one people actually ask for first - "I tell it a bug in plain text and it
// finds it and fixes it". Nothing exercised that end to end, which meant the tools that answer it
// were covered only by unit tests and by me reading their output and being satisfied.
//
// The distinction that makes this worth running: a diagnostic tool can be perfectly healthy and
// still useless, by returning a reply that is true and unactionable. "score: 72" is true. So is
// "3 findings". Neither tells a model which node to touch. So every check here asserts the reply
// contains the thing a model would need to ACT - a node id, an asset path, a name - and not merely
// that the call succeeded.
//
// The defect is planted rather than borrowed from the open project, because a trial that depends on
// a particular project's mistakes stops working the moment somebody fixes them.
//
// Usage: node scripts/trial-diagnose.mjs               (needs an editor open)
//        node scripts/trial-diagnose.mjs --by-preset   (same trial, on the "diagnose" preset alone)
//
// --by-preset is how the preset earns the word "sufficient". A curated tool list always LOOKS
// complete; the only way to know is to run the whole loop with nothing else switched on and see
// whether it finishes. If a tool is missing, this fails on the step that needed it.
