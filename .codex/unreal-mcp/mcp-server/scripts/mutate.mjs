// Break the code on purpose and see whether the suite notices.
//
// 891 tests pass. That is a statement about the tests, not about the code: a test can assert the
// wrong thing and pass forever. Three were nearly written that way in a single session - one that
// checked a field had MOVED rather than that the reply was unchanged, one that would have demanded a
// retype succeed when the honest answer was that it had been declined, one that could have passed by
// never starting a server at all.
//
// So: change one operator, run the suite, put it back. A mutant that survives is a claim nothing is
// checking.
//
// ## Reading the result
//
// A surviving mutant means one of TWO things and they are easy to confuse:
//
//   - a missing test, or
//   - code that does not matter.
//
// The first survivor found here was the second kind. `rankCandidates` has an early return for an
// empty needle, and removing it changed nothing - because the substring arm below already requires
// three characters, so an empty needle can never reach it. The way to tell them apart is to ask what
// the mutant RETURNS, not to assume a hole.
//
// ## Why it derives the mutations
//
// A hand-written list of "things to break" is a hand-maintained index, and this repo has watched four
// of those rot. These come from the source: every comparison and boolean operator is a decision, and
// flipping one is the smallest change that alters behaviour.
//
// Usage:
//   node scripts/mutate.mjs src/matchTerms.ts            one file, up to 12 mutants
//   node scripts/mutate.mjs src/audit.ts --max 4         fewer, when the suite is slow
//   node scripts/mutate.mjs src/a.ts src/b.ts            several files
//
// Each mutant costs a full `npm test` (about a minute), so this is an on-demand tool for code you
// just changed, not part of the suite.
