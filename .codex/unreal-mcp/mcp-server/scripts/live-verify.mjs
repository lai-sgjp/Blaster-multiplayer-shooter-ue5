// Live verification against a running Unreal Editor.
//
// Compiling proves the plugin builds. Running it against a real editor is the only thing that
// proves a command works, and this project has twice been saved by that distinction (a duplicated
// override-event node on 5.8, an EngineVersion pin that every build check ignored and the runtime
// loader did not). This script is that check, made repeatable instead of hand-run.
//
// Usage: node scripts/live-verify.mjs [--keep]
//   --keep  leave the created assets in the project instead of deleting them at the end
//
// It creates everything it needs under /Game/MCPLiveVerify/ and deletes it again, so it is safe
// to run against a real project, though a scratch project is still the polite choice.
