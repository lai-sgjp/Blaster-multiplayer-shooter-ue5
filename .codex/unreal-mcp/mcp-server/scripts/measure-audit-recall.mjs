// Of the bugs the GAME actually hits, how many does static analysis find first?
//
// Runtime errors are the only ground truth this project has. A finding from the audit is an opinion
// about what might go wrong; a line in the PIE log is a thing that DID. So the log is a labelled
// test set, and the honest question is how much of it the static checks already cover.
//
// This exists because of one miss. review_blueprint returned 35 findings for PC_Gameplay and not
// one of them was the null GM_Gameplay read the game logs twice a session - the check looked at
// Cast nodes and this project caches the GameMode in a variable. That gap was invisible until the
// two sources were put side by side, which nothing did.
//
// Measured against auditProject, NOT reviewBlueprint. The first version of this script used review,
// and that was wrong in a way worth recording: the multiplayer checks - cast-to-server-only-class,
// reads-server-only-variable, server-writes-unreplicated - run only in the audit. Reviewing each
// Blueprint therefore scored the audit's best checks as absent and reported a recall the tooling
// was never going to hit. A harness that measures the wrong surface is worse than no harness,
// because its number gets believed.
//
// A miss here is not automatically a defect. Whether an array Get is in range depends on what is in
// the array, and no static check can know that. The number is a place to look, not a score.
//
