// Every node type the bridge can build must be reachable, or deliberately not.
//
// check:parity guards the command surface: 93 bridge commands, 115 MCP tools, all matched. It says
// nothing about the surface INSIDE a command, and add_node is the widest one in the project - a
// `nodeType` string that selects between fourteen kinds of graph node. That inner surface drifted:
//
//   InputKey, InputAxis, Self - implemented in C++, accepted by the bridge, in no tool's enum
//
// So the engine could place them, the bridge could place them, and no model could ask. This is the
// second time the same thing has happened in the same command; the netMode/reliable parameters were
// implemented and unreachable too, which meant a Server RPC - the thing all multiplayer logic is
// built from - could not be authored at all. That one was found by reading the C++ for another
// reason. This one was found by reading an error message from an out-of-date plugin binary, which
// happened to LIST what it accepted. Neither is a way to find things.
//
// The reverse direction matters just as much: an enum offering a nodeType the bridge does not
// implement is a tool advertising something that returns unknown_node_type at the worst moment.
//
// Run: npm run check:nodetypes  (also part of npm test)
