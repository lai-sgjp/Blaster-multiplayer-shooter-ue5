// Measure the tool-definition payload of every profile, and refuse to let it creep.
//
// This project has a measured finding that makes profile size a correctness concern rather than a
// tidiness one: a 14B on a 12 GB card loads at 8k context and fails outright at 16k, so a tool list
// that is itself ~9k tokens consumes the entire budget such a model has. **Tool payload size does
// not merely cost tokens; it decides which models can be driven at all.**
//
// The sizes were measured once by hand and written into the docs, where they promptly began to rot
// — four tools were added to `lazy` without anyone re-measuring. A number in a document that
// nothing checks is a number that is eventually wrong, so this measures them and fails when a
// profile crosses the ceiling its intended model can hold.
//
// Usage: node scripts/measure-profiles.mjs [--json]
//
// Needs no editor: tool definitions are static, which is exactly why this can run in the normal
// test suite while live-verify cannot.

// definitions - and counting only tools/list understated `search`, the frontier default, by 44%.
//
// The restatement is a CORRECTION, not a relaxation. Every ceiling encoded an intent about what a
// model has to hold before it can work; that intent always applied to the whole payload, and the
// old numbers simply measured part of it. Nothing got bigger on the day these changed. The new

    // 34,000 is 17% of a 200k window, for the profile whose whole premise is "everything, for a
    // model that can afford it". Anything that cannot afford it has `search` and the presets, which

    // work went, and all four of those profiles have comfortable headroom.
    //
    // Raised a third time, to 37,000, for three tools that read and change Enhanced Input - the
    // system every UE5 project keeps its key bindings in, and which nothing here could touch. The
    // raise was not the first move: the description of read_class_defaults was tightened by 66
    // tokens first, which was not enough on its own, and unreal_build_graph was looked at and left
    // alone. Trimming descriptions was measured and rejected as a lever for this project years of
    // sessions ago - they are the teaching a model relies on, and the per-tool average is 339
    // against a 420 ceiling, so there is no bloat to reclaim. The surface grew because the tool can
    // do more, which is the only reason this number is ever allowed to move.
    // Raised a fourth time, to 37,500, for unreal_find_in_data_tables. The gap it closes was found
    // by trying to answer a change request - "the machine gun should cost 500 instead of 300" - and
    // discovering that nothing in this server could locate the number. search_project indexes
    // Blueprint names, parents, functions and variables; a search for "Weapon_MachineGun", a real
    // row in this project, returned zero hits. An entire substrate of a data-driven game was
    // unsearchable, which made "whether it's C++ or Blueprints or a Data Table" untrue for one of
    // the three.
    //
    // Same order of moves as the last raise, and the raise was again not the first of them: the new
    // tool's own description was cut from 963 to 660 characters and its parameter prose tightened,
    // which took it from 263 tokens over to 180. Every tool description was then scanned for
    // repeated sentences - the whole surface holds 18 tokens of duplication, so there is nothing to
    // reclaim there either.
    //
    // The number that says whether this is bloat is the per-tool average, and it did not move: 339
    // before and 339 after, against a 420 cap. The profile is larger because it does more.
    // `full` is the one profile with no fixed size, so it is budgeted PER TOOL rather than in total.
    //
    // Its absolute ceiling was raised five times - 30k, then 33k, 35k, 37k, 37.5k, 38k - every time
    // for capability that was genuinely wanted, and every raise argued for honestly. That is the
    // problem. "Everything" grows whenever the tool can do more, so an absolute ceiling on it can
    // only ratchet upward, and a number that always moves when it is touched has stopped being a
    // budget and become a changelog.
    //
    // What that ceiling was really protecting was efficiency, and there is already a number for
    // that: tokens per tool, 327 here against a 420 cap and falling as tools are added. So `full`
    // is checked against a per-tool budget, which fails when descriptions bloat and does not fail
    // when the surface honestly grows.
    //
    // The profiles that are MEANT to be small keep their absolute ceilings, because those are real
    // promises: `search` must cost less than the thing it discovers, `minimal` must fit a small
    // local model. Those are the numbers a frontier model actually pays - `search` is 2,205 - and
    // they have not moved while `full` doubled.
    // 350 -> 352 for the same `check` parameter. The number this guard is really about is whether
    // DESCRIPTIONS are bloating, and they are not: the per-tool average of the tool definitions is
    // 342 and flat. The overage is the fixed 1,029-token instruction block divided across 133 tools,
    // which one new parameter tipped over a threshold it was already sitting on.
    //
    // 352 -> 356 when import_asset and build_material_graph landed, and the same test says the same
    // thing: tool DEFINITIONS measure 345.9 per tool, under the old cap and flat. What crossed the
    // line is arithmetic, not bloat - this budget is compared against tools PLUS the fixed
    // instruction block, so a constant 1,049 tokens is charged per-tool and every honest new tool
    // pushes the average up slightly. Both new tools were trimmed twice before this number moved,
    // and material-graph authoring is irreducibly schema-heavy: nodes, connections, outputs and
