// Everything this server can create, it should be able to rename and remove - and each of those
// operations should leave the project consistent rather than merely different.
//
// Eight bridge commands were added across four sessions to close that gap: rename_asset,
// duplicate_asset, rename_variable, remove_variable, rename_component, remove_component,
// remove_function, create_asset. Every one compiles against 5.6, 5.8 and the game target, and not
// one has been RUN, because the plugin binary in the editor predates all of them.
//
// That is a real risk and it grows quietly: the day the plugin is rebuilt, eight commands go live
// having never been executed once. This trial is the thing that runs the moment they exist. Today it
// reports what it cannot run and exits 2; after a rebuild it either passes or finds what compiling
// could not.
//
// What it checks is not "did the call return ok". A rename that changed a name and left every
// referencing node pointing at the old one has not renamed anything, so each step asserts the
// CONSEQUENCE: the new name is readable, the old one is gone, the nodes moved with it, and a removal
// that would break something refuses instead.
