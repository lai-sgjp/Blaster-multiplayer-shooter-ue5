// Audit the claim that restarting the editor mid-session costs nothing.
//
// Complaint A6 says: the MCP server holds no editor connection between calls, so it cannot go
// stale — restart the editor whenever you like and the next tool call reconnects. Competing
// projects report the opposite (zombie processes to kill by hand, both the editor and the client
// needing a full restart), so this is a real differentiator, and it had never been tested.
//
// The test is the honest one: hold ONE long-lived client, restart the editor underneath it, and
// see whether the next call works without touching the client.
//
// Usage: node scripts/verify-restart.mjs --project <path-to-.uproject> --editor <path-to-UnrealEditor.exe>
