/**
 * Put a number on the rubber-band, instead of arguing about it.
 *
 * Rubber-banding is a DISAGREEMENT: the server has the dragged character somewhere the owning
 * client does not, so the client keeps getting corrected and the player sees a snap-back. That is
 * measurable without watching anything - sample the same pawn's position in both worlds at the same
 * moment and look at the distance between the two answers.
 *
 * This exists because two fixes were shipped on the strength of reasoning and both were wrong. One
 * made it judder in place; the other moved nothing at all. Neither was measured before or after, so
 * neither could be compared to anything.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/measure-rubberband.mjs [--seconds 8] [--label before]
