// What does a whole TASK cost, and does dispatch mode make it cheaper or dearer?
//
// Everything else here measures one number at a time: measure-profiles guards the standing cost of
// the tool definitions, measure-reads guards what a single reply costs. Neither answers the question
// a frontier model's bill is actually made of, which is what it costs to finish a piece of work.
//
// The two modes trade against each other and nobody had put a number on the trade:
//
//   full    every tool advertised. Large standing cost, paid once and then served from the prompt
//           cache, and each call is a direct call with no wrapper.
//   search  three tools advertised. Tiny standing cost, but every call goes through
//           unreal_call_tool, which costs a wrapper on the way in and can add guidance on the way
//           out - and that is per call, so it grows with the task while the standing saving does not.
//
// So there is a break-even, and where it sits decides which mode to recommend. Guessing at it would
// be exactly the kind of unmeasured claim the rest of this repo exists to avoid.
//
// A note on the standing cost, because it is easy to overstate. The tool list is sent before the
// system prompt and the messages, so with prompt caching it is paid at full price ONCE and read
// cheaply after that. It is NOT re-charged per turn. What re-charges it is a change to the tool
// list, which is why unreal_enable_tools is expensive and unreal_call_tool exists.
//
// Usage: node scripts/measure-task-cost.mjs        (needs an editor open)
