// Measure what tool REPLIES cost, and refuse to let them creep.
//
// check-tool-parity guards the tool list, check-docs guards the documentation, and
// measure-profiles guards the tool DEFINITIONS - the standing cost paid before a conversation
// starts. Nothing guarded the other half: what a tool costs when it answers.
//
// That gap was not hypothetical. Two things were found the day this script was written, both by
// measuring rather than by reading:
//
//   - unreal_list_tools, the tool whose entire purpose is keeping the surface cheap, answered with
//     every tool at 5,523 tokens. That is more than four times the whole `search` profile it exists
//     to protect. It had grown one tool at a time and nobody re-ran the number.
//   - unreal_enable_tools echoed every enabled tool name back, so enabling ONE tool cost the same
//     700 tokens as enabling thirty-two, and the reply was mostly a repeat of the tools/list the
//     client had just been told about.
//
// Both are the same failure: a reply that grows with the project while the number that would have
// exposed it lives in a document nobody re-measures. This makes it fail the build instead.
//
// Only editor-free tools are covered, deliberately. Anything that reads a real project produces a
// reply whose size depends on the project, so a fixed ceiling would be meaningless and would fail
// on somebody else's machine. Those are measured against a live editor by measure-cost.mjs.
//
// Usage: node scripts/check-response-budgets.mjs [--json]
