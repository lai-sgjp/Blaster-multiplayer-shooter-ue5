/**
 * A minimal MCP stdio client for the measurement scripts.
 *
 * Extracted rather than copied. Two scripts needed to speak JSON-RPC to this server over stdio, and
 * copying the twenty lines that do it is how a repo ends up with two clients that drift - one gets a
 * timeout, the other does not, and the difference only shows up as a hanging script months later.
 * The same lesson the engine-build scripts learned by having two of themselves.
 *
 * This is deliberately not the SDK client: these scripts measure what a client actually receives on
 * the wire, so they should do exactly what a client does and nothing more.

 * printed into a measurement table reads as a number that was measured - it has a value, it lines up
 * in the column, and nothing anywhere says it failed. That cost a wrong reading in this repo before
 * anyone noticed the output said "NaN tok".
 *
