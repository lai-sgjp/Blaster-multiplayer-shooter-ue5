// The scratch namespace the trials build in, and the sweep that keeps it empty.
//
// /Game/MCPTrial exists so a trial can create real assets in the real project without touching
// anything a person made. Every trial deletes what it created in a `finally`.
//
// That was not enough. Seven BP_TrialParent* Blueprints had accumulated there, from runs killed
// before `finally` could execute - an editor restart mid-trial, a timeout, a Ctrl-C. Nothing was
// broken and nothing complained, which is why they sat there long enough to reach seven: the next
// run creates its own uniquely-stamped assets and never looks at what is already present.
//
// They surfaced only when an unrelated script crashed on one - list_blueprints still reported a
// Blueprint whose file had gone, and reading it threw. So a leak nobody was paying for became a
// confusing failure somewhere else entirely, which is the usual way scratch data eventually costs
// something.
//
// Two rules, and the first is the one that matters:
//
//   1. Sweep on the way IN, not only on the way out. An exit path cannot clean up after a process
//      that is no longer running, and it is the crashed runs that leak by definition.
//   2. A failed delete is reported. `.catch(() => {})` in a cleanup block is how a trial prints
//      "cleaned up 2 assets" while leaving both behind.
//   3. A delete is judged by what it deleted, not by whether it threw. delete_asset returns
//      {requested: 1, deleted: 0} as a SUCCESS response when the engine refuses, so a cleanup that
//      only catches exceptions counts that as done. Checking the count is the difference between
//      this sweep working and it printing the same reassuring line the old one did.
