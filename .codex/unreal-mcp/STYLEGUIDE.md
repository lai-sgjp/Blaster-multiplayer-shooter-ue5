# Style Guide

The conventions this codebase already follows, written down so they stay consistent as the
project grows and as new contributions (human or AI) land. If you're fixing style drift, this is
the reference to check against.

## C++ (`UnrealMCPBridge/`)

Follows Epic's own Unreal Engine coding standard, since that's what every UE developer already
expects and what the engine's own headers model throughout the codebase:

- **Naming**: `PascalCase` for types, functions, and methods. `F` prefix for plain structs/classes
  (`FMCPProjectIndex`), `U` for `UObject`-derived classes, `T` for templates (`TArray`, `TMap`,
  `TUniquePtr`, `TSharedPtr`), `E` for enums, `b` prefix for booleans (`bBuilt`,
  `bAssetRegistryStillScanning`). Local variables and function parameters are also `PascalCase`
  (this is Epic's convention, not a typo): `PascalCase` for everything except member fields with
  no prefix, which don't exist here since every field either has a type prefix or is private.
- **Braces**: Allman style, with the opening brace on its own line, for functions, classes, and
  control flow alike:
  ```cpp
  if (!Blueprint)
  {
      return MakeErrorResponse(LoadError);
  }
  ```
- **Indentation**: tabs, not spaces (matches Epic's own source and `.editorconfig` defaults for UE
  projects).
- **Headers**: `#pragma once`, not include guards. Forward-declare where possible (see
  `MCPTcpServer.h`'s `class FSocket;` etc) instead of including headers a `.h` doesn't need.
- **Error handling**: commands return `bool` with an `FString& OutError` output parameter rather
  than throwing or asserting. Every command path in `MCPCommandHandler.cpp` reports failures back
  as a structured JSON error (`{"ok": false, "error": "..."}`) instead of crashing the editor.
  Never use engine `check()`/`ensure()` on data that comes from an MCP request; those are for
  programmer errors, not malformed input from a client.
- **Comments**: `/** ... */` Doxygen-style block comments on classes and non-obvious public
  methods, explaining *why* something exists or a non-obvious constraint (see `MCPProjectIndex.h`'s
  class comment). Single-line `//` comments inline only when the *why* isn't obvious from the code
  itself, not restating what the next line does. No em dashes in comments; use a period, comma, or
  colon instead, whichever reads most naturally. No emoji.
- **Response builders**: use the shared `MakeOkResponse` / `MakeErrorResponse` helpers rather than
  building `FJsonObject`s inline, and avoid short generic helper names (`MakeError`, `Check`,
  `Verify`, etc.) in files that transitively include Core headers. This collided with UE's own
  `Templates/ValueOrError.h` once already (see `docs/M1_STATUS.md`).
- **Threading**: everything in this plugin runs on the game thread by design (the TCP server ticks
  via `FTSTicker`, AssetRegistry delegates fire on the game thread) specifically so command
  handlers can call Editor/Kismet2/AssetRegistry APIs directly with no locking. Don't introduce a
  background thread without re-checking this assumption project-wide.

## TypeScript (`mcp-server/`)

- **Formatting**: 2-space indentation, double quotes for strings, semicolons, trailing commas in
  multi-line literals.
- **Naming**: `camelCase` for variables and functions, `PascalCase` for interfaces and types
  (`BridgeRequest`, `SearchHit`). Interfaces over `type` aliases for object shapes; `type` for
  unions/utility types.
- **Types**: explicit return types on exported functions. Prefer `unknown` over `any`; narrow with
  a real check or a cast with a comment explaining why the cast is safe.
- **Async**: `async`/`await` throughout, except where wrapping a callback-based Node API
  (`bridgeClient.ts`'s `net.Socket` handling) genuinely requires `new Promise(...)`.
- **Comments**: `/** ... */` JSDoc on exported functions and non-obvious module-level constants.
  Module-header comments (see the top of `enrichment.ts`) are fine for explaining a whole file's
  design rationale when it isn't obvious from the code alone. Same em-dash/emoji rules as C++.
- **Error handling**: bridge-facing calls throw `Error` with a message that tells the *user* what
  to check (see `bridgeClient.ts`'s `ECONNREFUSED` message) rather than a bare stack trace. MCP
  tool handlers catch and convert to `errorResult(err)`. A thrown error should never escape a
  tool call and crash the server.

## Documentation (`*.md`)

- No em dashes (—). Use a period, comma, colon, or parentheses instead, whichever reads most
  naturally for that sentence. (The character above is the rule naming itself, and is the one
  place in the repo it is allowed to appear. A sweep that finds any other instance should fix it.)
- No emoji, anywhere, including status docs and commit messages.
- Arrows (`→`) are fine for flow/sequence notation (`list → summary → detail`). That's a
  deliberate technical-writing convention, not decorative.
- Headings: sentence case, not Title Case (`## What's different about this one`, not
  `## What's Different About This One`).
- Code identifiers, file paths, and commands always in backticks inline; fenced code blocks with a
  language tag (` ```cpp `, ` ```ts `, ` ```bash `) for anything longer than one line.
- Status docs (`docs/M*_STATUS.md`, `docs/LIVE_VERIFICATION.md`) report what's actually
  verified versus what's compiled-but-unverified, explicitly and separately. Never blur the two.

## Commit messages

Imperative mood summary line (`Fix duplicate-event bug`, not `Fixed` or `Fixes`), body explaining
*why* the change matters and what was actually verified, not just what changed (the diff already
shows what changed). No em dashes, no emoji.

## Naming consistency across the project

- "Blueprint" (capitalized) when referring to the UE concept, never "blueprint" or "BP" in prose
  (code identifiers like `BP_Foo` are fine).
- "MCP" always uppercase, never "Mcp" or "mcp" in prose (lowercase `mcp-server` is fine as the
  literal folder/package name).
- Command names in the bridge protocol are `snake_case` (`get_project_overview`); MCP tool names
  are `unreal_`-prefixed `snake_case` (`unreal_get_project_overview`); C++ handler methods are
  `PascalCase` (`HandleGetProjectOverview`). This three-way mapping is consistent throughout
  `MCPCommandHandler.cpp` and `index.ts`, so keep it that way for any new command.
