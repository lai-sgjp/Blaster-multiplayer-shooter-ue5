	// thread, and the very next call was refused for too many connections. One tick later the reap
	// loop had cleared all of them and the bridge was fine - so nothing here was wrong except when
	// it ran.
	//
	// Arriving first does not entitle a connection to a slot. It has to still be there - and
	// "still be there" has to be asked the way ProcessClientSocket asks it, not the obvious way.
	//
	// The first version of this check used IsConnected(), which wraps GetConnectionState(). That
	// does not detect an orderly close: it still answers SCS_Connected for a peer that hung up
	// minutes ago. This file already says so two hundred lines down, in the comment explaining why

	// did nothing.
	//
	// So probe them the way the servicing loop does. ProcessClientSocket reads what is there into
	// RecvBuffer, answers any complete request, and sets bPeerClosed when Recv reports end of
	// stream, which means nothing is thrown away by asking early: a client that connected and has
	// not spoken yet reads zero bytes and stays, and a client that sent a request and vanished still
