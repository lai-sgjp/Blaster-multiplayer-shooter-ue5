# Competitive landscape: Unreal Engine MCP servers

Survey date: 2026-08-07, with the first-party section re-checked 2026-08-31 and again 2026-09-02 (nothing new: still Experimental, localhost-only, unauthenticated and Tools-only; the UEFN ship of 20 Aug remains the most recent move). Scope: the 9 third-party GitHub repos identified as of this date as
competing/related "MCP server for Unreal Engine" projects, plus Epic's own first-party
experimental plugin in UE 5.8 as a non-competitor comparison point.

**Methodology.** For each repo: fetched repo metadata via the GitHub REST API
(`api.github.com/repos/<owner>/<repo>`, which includes GitHub's own license-file detection),
fetched `LICENSE`/`LICENSE.md`/`LICENSE.txt` directly from `raw.githubusercontent.com` (trying
all three filenames, not just trusting the API's detector), and fetched `README.md` plus, for a
few repos, one supporting file (`CLAUDE.md`, etc.) the same way. No repository was cloned. All
figures (stars, forks, tool counts) are a point-in-time snapshot and, for tool/action counts, are
self-reported by each project's own README unless noted otherwise. None of this was verified
against actual source. Nothing in this document reproduces source code from any surveyed repo;
architectural ideas are described in our own words for evaluation purposes.

**Where we are for comparison.** Per `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/M1_STATUS.md` /
`docs/M2_STATUS.md`: a C++ editor plugin (`UnrealMCPBridge`) + Node/TypeScript MCP server,
targeting stock-launcher UE 5.6/5.8 with no engine source dependency. M1 (tiered read-only
Blueprint introspection) and M2 (structured write/edit commands) are built and compile-verified
against a real UE 5.8 install. M3, `MCPProjectIndex` (`UnrealMCPBridge/Source/UnrealMCPBridge/`),
is also built: an in-memory index of every Blueprint's functions/variables/graphs/node-type
histograms, persisted to `Saved/UnrealMCPBridge/index.json`, kept fresh via `IAssetRegistry`'s
`OnAssetAdded`/`Removed`/`Renamed`/`Updated` delegates (no polling), backing a substring `Search()`
and a `find_references` command that calls the AssetRegistry's real `GetReferencers`/
`GetDependencies` at the package level.

The two highest-starred repos in the survey have both gone quiet for over a year. The
most-recently-active and most professionally engineered repo (ChiR24) is mid-tier by star count.
Star count in this space currently lags actual maintenance activity, worth remembering when
sizing up "the competition."

## Per-project notes

### chongdashu/unreal-mcp
The project most people mean when they say "Unreal MCP" right now by star count, but stale for
over a year. C++ `UEditorSubsystem` running a TCP server on port 55557, paired with a Python
FastMCP server that loads tool modules from a `tools/` directory. Its Blueprint feature set is
entirely about **creating and configuring** Blueprints/components/nodes: every bullet in its
README's "Blueprint Node Graph" section is an add/create/connect verb; there is no read-existing-
structure-back-out tool at all, consistent with the task brief's note that it doesn't parse
existing Blueprint structure. No mention of token/context efficiency anywhere. README claims MIT
(badge + text) but there is no LICENSE file anywhere in the repo (checked LICENSE, LICENSE.md,
LICENSE.txt, and a full root-directory listing). GitHub's own detector agrees, reporting no
license.

What's genuinely good: the bundled ready-to-open `MCPGameProject` sample project (plugin
pre-installed) lowers time-to-first-success: a new user can see it work before touching their
own project. Its per-MCP-client config table (client name → exact config file path per OS) is a
small, high-value documentation pattern that several later, more sophisticated projects
independently converged on too.

### sam-david/unreal-mcp
Tiny adoption (4 stars) despite a sophisticated pitch. Its core idea is the most interesting thing
about it: **no mandatory C++ plugin at all.** It drives the engine through two things every stock
UE install already ships: the Python Editor Script Plugin's Remote Execution (UDP multicast +
inverted TCP) and the Remote Control API (HTTP REST). It only reaches for an optional C++
plugin when it needs K2 graph-node manipulation specifically. The server "probes all transports on
startup" and degrades gracefully if one isn't available. Its own README comparison table claims
127 tools across 16 subsystems beat every other repo in this survey on tool count, and the
per-module counts in that table do sum to exactly 127: internally consistent, though unverified
against actual source. No mention of token/context efficiency; no read-existing-structure
compaction described beyond generic Remote Control property gets. README claims MIT; no LICENSE
file exists anywhere in the repo.

What's genuinely good: "prefer the engine's own built-in scripting surface over a custom native
plugin, and only add compiled code for the one thing the built-ins can't reach" is a legitimately
good minimal-friction install strategy, with zero build step for ~95% of functionality. The tradeoff
(UDP multicast Remote Execution is fragile behind VPNs/Tailscale/multiple NICs, and the README's own
troubleshooting section documents this at length) is real and worth taking seriously before
copying the pattern.

### remiphilippe/mcp-unreal
Single statically-linked Go binary, zero external runtime dependencies, prebuilt cross-platform
releases (macOS/Linux/Windows × amd64/arm64) on GitHub Releases, the lowest-friction install of
anything in this survey (no Python venv, no `npm install`). Apache-2.0, confirmed directly from the
LICENSE file content. Hard-pinned to UE 5.7 (paths and docs reference `UE_5.7` specifically, not a
"+" range). Genuinely does have a persistent, disk-backed search index (`docs/index.bleve`, built
by `mcp-unreal --build-index`), but confirmed from the README to index **markdown files under
`docs/ue5.7/` and `docs/realtimemesh/`, plus the calling project's `CLAUDE.md`**, i.e. API/engine
documentation text, not the project's own Blueprints or assets. Separately, `get_asset_info`
returns "dependencies and referencers" for a given asset, which is a live, per-request
AssetRegistry-style lookup with no stated caching/persistence layer of its own.

What's genuinely good: (1) the bundled "Recommended System Prompt" block, a ready-made paragraph
telling the calling agent the right tool-call order (check status → look up docs before writing
code → build → test → save), is a cheap, effective reliability win, and the README's worked
example transcripts (exact tool-call sequences for realistic requests) reinforce it well. (2) A
genuine headless path (`build_project`/`run_tests`/`cook_project` invoke `UnrealEditor-Cmd`
directly via `exec.Command`, no live editor required) opens up CI/batch use cases none of our
current architecture supports. (3) The documentation-index idea itself (distinct from a
project-structure index) is worth adopting in its own right: indexing Epic's own API docs so an
agent can look up a class/function reference without spending tokens re-deriving it from raw
engine headers is a complementary idea to what we do, not a competing one.

### ChiR24/Unreal_mcp
The most actively and professionally engineered repo in the survey, pushed the same day as this
survey, MIT-licensed (confirmed from the LICENSE file), supports the widest and most explicit UE
version range (5.0–5.8, with the README stating all versions in that range are "supported and
working"). Architecturally the standout feature is the **single gateway tool**: the MCP client
sees exactly one tool, `unreal`, which is called with an `operation` of `search`, `describe`,
`execute`, or `configure`; the 23 "canonical" tools (`manage_blueprint`, `control_actor`,
`manage_asset`, etc.) exist only behind that gateway. A client that tries to call a canonical tool
name directly gets a structured `DIRECT_TOOL_CALL_REMOVED` response telling it exactly what
gateway call to make instead. `manage_tools` additionally allows enabling/disabling tool groups at
runtime. This is a real, explicit design response to context-window pressure, but it targets
**tool-definition/tool-catalog size** (how many tool schemas the model has to hold and choose
between), not the size of any single tool's response payload. The README gives no evidence of a
tiered/summary-first strategy for reading Blueprint graph contents specifically. Caching is
explicit and short-lived only (`ASSET_LIST_TTL_MS`, default 10 seconds, in-memory), confirmed not
persistent.

What's genuinely good: (1) the gateway pattern itself, as the most battle-tested answer in this
survey to tool-catalog bloat, worth adapting once our own tool count grows past the point a model
reliably picks the right one. (2) Security defaults most others skip entirely: capability-token
auth **on by default** with an auto-generated per-project secret file, loopback-only binding by
default, and an explicit opt-in-with-warning for LAN exposure. (3) Real engineering discipline:
CI gates include a generated-manifest drift check, TS-vs-native tool-definition parity tests, and
a blocking dependency-audit gate, a good bar to hold ourselves to as the project matures.

### GenOrca/unreal-mcp
Apache-2.0 (confirmed directly from `LICENSE.txt`; note the non-default filename, which is why
the bare `LICENSE` fetch initially 404'd). Python-first (built-in Python Editor Script Plugin) with
an optional C++ helper module (`MCPythonHelper`) reserved for the handful of things Python can't
reach (e.g. skeleton bone introspection). Ships precompiled per-engine-version plugin `.zip`
releases so most users never compile anything. Architecture explicitly states the same
context-window rationale as ChiR24, independently arrived at: "the action set is large but the
tool list stays small, so it never bloats the model's context": one MCP tool per domain (21
domains), each dispatched via an `action` parameter, 253 actions total. Also explicitly offers
runtime self-description: calling a domain tool with `{"action":"list_actions"}` returns every
action's parameters and docs on demand, rather than front-loading all 253 actions' schemas into
every tool definition up front. Does have named `find_referencers`/`get_dependencies` asset tools
(real cross-asset reference/dependency queries), but nothing in the README indicates these are
backed by anything other than a live, per-request AssetRegistry call; no mention of a persisted
index file, no mention of surviving an editor restart, no mention of substring search across the
whole project by keyword.

What's genuinely good: (1) the domain-tool-plus-runtime-`list_actions`-discovery pattern is a
second, meaningfully different answer to the tool-catalog-bloat problem than ChiR24's static
gateway, worth comparing both before picking one. (2) An explicitly low-friction contribution
model ("add a `ue_<name>(...)` Python function, run `generate_catalog.py`, no C++, no editor
rebuild") is worth mirroring once we're open source and want outside contributions. (3) Naming
`find_referencers`/`get_dependencies` as first-class, discoverable tools (rather than folding them
into a generic search) is a signal that reference-lookup is something real users specifically
reach for, and validates keeping our own `find_references` prominent rather than buried.

### avdo403/UnrealMCP
Tiny adoption (4 stars, 0 forks) but a surprisingly broad feature set: procedural world
generation (castles, towns, dungeons via wave-function-collapse, L-system trees), an
`AIModule`/`MassEntity` AI-navigation layer, even an `ml/mcp_rl_agent.py` reinforcement-learning
module. C++ Editor Subsystem on the same port (55557) and general shape as chongdashu's project,
suggesting a derivative or convention carried over from it, paired with a Python FastMCP server
with optional Redis caching / Prometheus / Grafana (all off by default except in-memory caching
and metrics). README badge and footer both say MIT; no LICENSE file exists anywhere in the repo
(confirmed via a full root listing), one of four repos in this survey with this exact pattern. No
token/context-efficiency mentions; no persistent index; no reference/dependency search.

What's genuinely good: (1) "Blueprint Analysis: Analyze graph complexity and detect logic issues"
is a feature nothing else in this survey has: an automated Blueprint linter, in effect. This
maps cleanly onto data we already compute (our M3 index already builds a per-graph node-type
histogram), so a complexity/lint pass is a relatively short hop from where we already are. (2)
Shipping a typed config module (pydantic) plus a committed `.env.example` for every tunable is a
small but good config-hygiene habit.

### kvick-games/UnrealMCP
604 stars but explicitly and repeatedly self-described as "VERY WIP" in its own README, and stale
for over 14 months as of this survey. Blueprints are marked as not-yet-done in its own roadmap
checklist, so the star count reflects an early snapshot more than current capability. C++ plugin +
Python client scripts; notably has an in-editor toolbar button to start/stop the TCP server, with
server status visible in the editor UI rather than only in logs. The full standard MIT license
text (with a named copyright holder and year) is embedded directly in the README, but there is no
separate LICENSE file, so GitHub's detector reports no license, a middle case between "clean
license" and "no license at all." No token/context-efficiency mentions; no index or reference
search of any kind.

What's genuinely good: (1) the in-editor status/start-stop UI is a small but real UX idea we don't
currently have. It makes the bridge's connection state legible to a human working alongside the
agent, without needing to tail logs. (2) A prominent, specific safety disclaimer up top ("use
source control, make backups, test in a separate project first, you are responsible for
AI-made changes to your project") is good practice worth mirroring closely, since we, like this
project, perform destructive in-place writes to Blueprint assets.

### lilklon/UEBlueprintMCP
Small, focused project (36 stars) specifically scoped to Blueprint/Material/Widget/Input
manipulation with a persistent (not reconnect-per-call) TCP connection on port 55558. Its README
"License" section says only the word "MIT" with no badge, no link, and no grant text, weaker even
than chongdashu/sam-david/avdo403's badge-plus-claim pattern, and there is no LICENSE file
anywhere in the repo. Architecturally, every operation is described as flowing through
`FEditorAction` subclasses that provide "pre-execution validation, graceful error handling... and
automatic dirty package tracking and save": a consistent validate → execute → auto-save
lifecycle shared by every command type. No token/context-efficiency mentions; no persistent index.

What's genuinely good: (1) the `FEditorAction` base-class pattern is a clean, general C++
architecture for a command-handler layer. It factors validation, error formatting, and
save-tracking out of each individual command's logic instead of duplicating that boilerplate
across dozens of handlers. Worth comparing against how `MCPCommandHandler.cpp` is structured as our
own command count grows past a couple dozen. (2) Auto-saving dirty packages after every successful
write, combined with a persistent (not per-call) TCP socket, are both good defaults that reduce
the chance of an agent leaving a project with accumulated unsaved changes. (3) It ships a
`docs/SKILL.md` specifically written as a Claude Code Skill for using its own tools, a nice
formalization of "ship usage guidance as an artifact the agent actually loads," similar in spirit
to remiphilippe's system-prompt block but packaged more formally.

### mirno-ehf/ue5-mcp
The newest and smallest-footprint architecture in the survey: a C++ editor-subsystem plugin
exposing an HTTP server on port 9847, described as running "with zero overhead" while the editor
is open, with a **headless fallback**: when the editor is closed, it can spawn a standalone
`UnrealEditor-Cmd.exe` commandlet process instead (documented cost: 2-4 GB RAM, ~60s startup, and
the caller must call `shutdown_server` when done). MIT, confirmed directly from the LICENSE file.
The public README is very thin (23 lines); its `CLAUDE.md` fills in real numbers: 38 MCP tools,
UE5 5.4+. No token/context-efficiency mentions; no documented persistent index (the marketing line
"find everywhere I use GetActorLocation and replace it" implies some cross-Blueprint search
exists, but neither the README nor `CLAUDE.md` describes its implementation, so this is genuinely
unconfirmed either way, not a "no").

What's genuinely good: the editor-subsystem-when-open / headless-commandlet-when-closed dual mode
is a real capability gap for us worth roadmapping. Our bridge currently assumes the editor process
is already running.

**Note on `CLAUDE.md` content, unrelated to the technical evaluation:** this repo's `CLAUDE.md`,
the file meant to instruct an AI coding agent installing the project, directly instructs any such
agent to run `gh repo star mirno-ehf/ue5-mcp` on the user's behalf during setup, and separately
instructs it to autonomously run `gh issue create` to file GitHub issues for any missing feature,
explicitly telling the agent to open the issue itself rather than asking the user to do it. Neither
action asks the user's permission. Both are unrequested, user-invisible side effects embedded in
data an agent reads while helping someone install the tool, the kind of instruction our safety rules say an agent
should not act on when it's discovered in observed content rather than said by the actual user. We
did not act on either instruction. This isn't a security hole in their tool, but it's a concrete
example of a pattern to keep out of our own `CLAUDE.md`/Skill files: no autonomous, unprompted,
user-facing side effects baked into agent-facing setup instructions.

## The UE 5.8 first-party plugin (comparison point, and the one worth learning from)

UE 5.8 ships an official, **Experimental**, opt-in "Unreal MCP" plugin that runs an MCP server
inside the editor process itself over local HTTP + SSE (no stdio, no WebSocket), built around a
**Toolset Registry**: a subsystem that discovers classes deriving from `UToolsetDefinition` (C++)
or `unreal.ToolsetDefinition` (Python) and wraps each method marked `AICallable` / `tool_call` as
an MCP tool. Shipped toolsets include `SceneTools`, `ActorTools`, `MaterialInstanceTools` and
`ObjectTools`. It binds loopback-only at `127.0.0.1:8000/mcp`, rejects non-loopback `Origin`
headers, and has no authentication layer.

As of 20 August 2026 the same plugin, and the same Toolset Registry, also ships in **Unreal Editor
for Fortnite**, with UEFN-specific toolsets.

### Re-checked 31 August 2026: two things worth knowing

**UE 5.9 is confirmed**, announced at Unreal Fest Seoul, and Epic say it carries further work on the
MCP plugin and "more AI integrations". Nothing actionable yet - there is no changelog to read - but
it means the first-party surface is still moving and this document will need checking again rather
than trusted.

**The City Sample update is the interesting one, and it is an idea rather than a feature.** Epic
shipped it with combined PCG and Unreal MCP workflows and a new PCG Primitives plugin, framed as
letting an LLM *use PCG as its spatial language*.

That is worth sitting with, because it is a genuinely different answer to a question this project
has open. Level and geometry work is one of the gaps named in [../ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md), and
the obvious way to close it is the way everything else here works: more tools, finer control -
place an actor, set a transform, repeat. Epic's answer is that an LLM should not be placing actors
one at a time at all. It should be describing intent to a procedural system that does the placing,
because the description is small and the result is large.

The parallel to this project's own central finding is exact. Reading a graph node-by-node cost
126,477 tokens and reading what the graph DOES costs 3,804; placing a city actor-by-actor is the
same mistake in a different medium. **Nothing has been built here on the strength of it** - this is
a note that the shape of the answer is probably "describe intent to a generator", not "add fifty
placement tools", and the next person to open the level-authoring question should read Epic's
version before designing ours.

### Correcting what this document said before

An earlier revision of this section claimed the first-party plugin had "no discussion of token
budgets or response compaction". **That was wrong**, and it was wrong about the single most
important thing Epic did. The plugin ships **Tool Search mode, and it is the default**:
`tools/list` returns three meta-tools — `list_toolsets`, `describe_toolset`, `call_tool` — instead
of advertising every schema, and the agent pulls in what it needs. Epic's own guidance is to prefer
it because "it keeps schema tokens out of every API call". There is also a
`ModelContextProtocol.PaginationPageSize` console variable for capping response items.

That is the same problem this project measures obsessively, reached independently, and Epic made
the aggressive choice the default. It is direct evidence that the standing cost of tool definitions
is a first-order design concern and not a niche worry about small models — which is how this
project had been framing it, right up until `full` was quietly costing every frontier session
25.5k tokens a turn.

**Adopted.** The `search` profile is this idea, with one deliberate difference: Epic routes every
call through a generic `call_tool(name, args)`, which means the agent works from a schema it
fetched separately rather than from a validated tool definition. `search` instead registers every
tool with its real schema and merely leaves it switched off, so `unreal_enable_tools` hands back
fully typed definitions with enums and constraints intact. Same saving, no loss of type fidelity.
Measured: 4 tools / ~1.2k tokens standing, against 80 / ~25.5k for `full`.

### What it still does not do, and we do

- **Reading an existing project.** Its documented tools are spawn/configure/run-automation actions.
  There is no tiered Blueprint summarisation, no persistent asset index, no `find_references`, and
  no dependency search. Understanding a project you did not write is the harder half of this
  problem and it is the half this project is built around.
- **Blueprint graph authoring.** No documented equivalent of placing a whole graph atomically,
  laying it out, and compiling with structured errors.
- **UE 5.6.** It is 5.8-only. There is no first-party equivalent for 5.6, which this project also
  targets from one source tree.
- **MCP Resources and Prompts.** Not advertised by the shipped toolsets.
- **Letting a model see.** `unreal_screenshot` captures the viewport, downscales it to a long-edge
  budget and returns a real MCP image content block. Verified live on 2026-08-30 against the running
  editor: an 876x264 viewport came back as a valid 438x132 PNG, roughly 77 image tokens. This was
  listed below as something Epic did and we did not, for longer than it was true. What we still
  cannot show a model is a *graph* - only the viewport is renderable, so `unreal_explain_graph` and
  the node summary remain the only way to see Blueprint logic.

### What it does that we do not

- **Third-party extensibility.** Anyone can add a toolset in C++ or Python and it appears as MCP
  tools with no changes to the server. Our 81 tools are a fixed, hand-curated surface. That is a
  deliberate trade — every tool here is documented, parity-checked and measured — but it does mean
  a studio with its own pipeline cannot expose it through this bridge without patching the repo.
- **Gameplay Ability System.** Epic ships an `AttributeSetToolset` in its GASToolsets plugin. We
  have nothing for GAS: no attribute sets, no gameplay effects, no ability blueprints. For a project
  built on GAS - which is a large share of serious UE projects - that is a whole subsystem this
  bridge cannot see or author. This is the most substantial remaining gap in this list.
- **Third-party toolset registration at runtime.** Covered above; repeated here because it is what
  makes the GAS gap self-healing for them and not for us.
- **Agent Skills.** Instruction bundles (`AgentSkill`, `AgentSkillToolset`) that teach an agent how
  to use a toolset correctly — workflow steps, pitfalls, safety constraints, verification steps —
  shipped as assets rather than prose. We cover the same ground with the server `instructions`
  field, the three guide prompts and `unreal_guide`, and arguably cover it better because ours
  arrives automatically rather than needing to be asked for. Worth watching rather than copying.
- **Console-command lifecycle.** `StartServer` / `StopServer` / `RefreshTools` /
  `GenerateClientConfig` from inside the editor. Our equivalent of the last one is
  `--print-config`; we have no in-editor control surface at all.

### Re-checked 2026-08-30 (second pass)

Epic's plugin is **materially unchanged** since the first read: still Experimental, still the same
toolsets, still HTTP-only, still no Resources or Prompts. Nothing new to adopt there.

The ecosystem around it has moved, and one competitor is worth studying rather than dismissing.
**Monolith** advertises 1,400+ actions across 25+ namespaces - Blueprints, Materials, Animation,
Niagara, Mesh, UI, Behavior Trees, State Trees, EQS, GAS, Audio - with a "Reflection Intelligence"
layer doing replication census, RPC discovery, OnRep handler validation and C++ reflection queries.

**Its token strategy is the same family as ours, arrived at independently.** It does not ship 1,400
definitions: each namespace registers one `{namespace}_query()` dispatcher, `monolith_discover()`
returns terse one-line listings, and full schemas come on demand. That is Epic's `list_toolsets` /
`describe_toolset` / `call_tool` shape again, and the same problem our `search` profile solves. Ours
still has the edge that matters: after `enable_tools`, the tools are **real MCP tools with native
schemas**, so there is no dispatcher hop and no lost validation on every call.

**The one idea worth taking: universal response shaping.** They expose `_fields`, `_omit` and
`_compact_json` on every action, so a caller can ask for only the parts of a reply it needs. This
project does the same job per-tool instead - node caps, `match` filters, dropped false flags, wiring
flattened to one line - which is better tuned but only covers the tools that were tuned.

Adopting it *universally* was costed and rejected: an extra parameter on all 96 tools is roughly
40 tokens each, about 3,800 tokens of standing context, against reads that are already 1-3.7k. That
trade is negative. Applied to the handful of largest reads it is positive, which is where it belongs
if it is added at all.

**What they have that we do not, honestly:** Niagara, GAS, State Trees, EQS, Audio, motion matching,
and AnimGraph *authoring* (we read Anim Blueprints, we cannot build one). Niagara is the next gap by
the same reasoning that made animation and AI worth doing - 17 Niagara systems in the project this is
developed against, and "the effect does not play" is a sentence a person actually says.

Net effect on positioning: the first-party plugin validates the in-editor MCP surface and, on token
discipline, was ahead of us — that is now fixed and credited. It still does not compete on reading
and editing an existing project's Blueprints, and it does not exist for 5.6.

## Ideas worth adopting into our own roadmap

Every item below is a pattern described in a competitor's documentation, reimplemented in our own
words for evaluation, not code taken from any repo. None of the 9 surveyed repos are GPL/copyleft
(see license findings below), so there is no license-inheritance concern for any of these; they're
listed as general, cleanly-reimplementable patterns regardless.

1. **Adopt a gateway or namespaced-tool pattern once our own tool count grows.**
   ChiR24 (single `unreal` gateway, search/describe/execute/configure over 23 tools) and GenOrca
   (one tool per domain + `action` sub-dispatch + runtime `list_actions` self-description) are two
   different, both-credible answers to tool-catalog bloat. We don't need this yet (M1+M2 are a
   couple dozen commands), but should design our MCP-server-side tool registration so it's easy to
   collapse into one of these shapes later without a breaking rewrite.
   **Milestone: M4**, as a design decision to make before the tool count grows further, not before.

2. **Keep `find_references`/cross-asset dependency lookup a prominent, explicitly-named tool, not
   a buried search mode.** GenOrca and remiphilippe both independently ship named
   `find_referencers`/`get_dependencies`-style tools, validating real demand for this exact
   capability, which we already have as M3's `find_references`. Action item is really "don't
   deprioritize this in the tool list," not new work.
   **Milestone: already done (M3); carry the lesson into M4 tool-surface decisions.**

3. **Ship a bundled "recommended agent workflow" doc/Skill**, in the spirit of remiphilippe's
   README system-prompt block and lilklon's `docs/SKILL.md`: a short, concrete set of rules for the
   calling agent (read before write; use the tiered summary before requesting node detail; compile
   after every write; save when done). Cheap to write, directly improves real-world tool-use
   reliability, and doubles as onboarding documentation.
   **Milestone: M4.**

4. **Design a security posture now for whenever we add any non-stdio/non-loopback transport.**
   ChiR24's defaults (capability-token auth on by default with an auto-generated per-project
   secret file, loopback-only binding by default, explicit opt-in-with-warning for LAN access) are
   the strongest in the survey and worth adopting wholesale before (not after) we ship anything
   beyond local stdio/TCP.
   **Milestone: prerequisite for any M4+ networked transport, not urgent otherwise.**

5. **Blueprint complexity/lint pass**, inspired by avdo403's "detect logic issues" feature: flag
   graphs above a node-count threshold, orphaned nodes, excessive branching, etc. This builds
   directly on data M3 already computes (the per-graph node-type histogram in `MCPProjectIndex`),
   so it's a relatively small addition rather than new infrastructure.
   **Milestone: M4.**

6. **In-editor status UI** (toolbar button or status widget showing bridge connection state and
   index build status, start/stop control), inspired by kvick-games. Small UX polish item, makes
   the plugin's state legible to a human working alongside the agent without reading logs.
   **Milestone: M4.**

7. **Add a prominent, specific safety/backup disclaimer to our own README**, in the spirit of
   kvick-games' upfront disclaimer. We perform destructive in-place writes (M2) and should be at
   least as explicit about source-control/backup expectations before publishing.
   **Milestone: M4, as part of launch/publish prep. Do this before the GitHub repo goes public.**

8. **Consider a second, complementary documentation index, distinct from M3's project-structure
   index,** that indexes Epic's own API docs (and/or our own generated notes) the way
   remiphilippe's Bleve-backed docs index does, so an agent can look up a class/function reference
   without spending tokens re-deriving it from raw engine headers. Additive to M3, not a
   replacement.
   **Milestone: M5 (new index type; M3 is specifically the project-structure index and should stay
   scoped that way).**

9. **Design-spike a headless / editor-not-yet-running mode**, prompted by mirno-ehf's
   editor-subsystem-with-headless-commandlet-fallback and remiphilippe's `UnrealEditor-Cmd`-based
   headless build/test/cook path. Our current architecture assumes the editor process is already
   running; both competitors point at the same real gap (CI use cases, or simply "the user hasn't
   opened the editor yet").
   **Milestone: M5, a bigger architectural addition that needs its own design pass before scoping.**

10. **Ship precompiled per-engine-version plugin binaries as release assets** (GenOrca's pattern:
    a `.zip` per UE version so most users never compile the C++ plugin themselves), rather than
    requiring every user to build `UnrealMCPBridge` locally. Directly relevant since we already
    target stock launcher installs specifically.
    **Milestone: M4, release engineering, needed once we publish.**

## License findings (why this matters for us specifically)

We will not copy code from any of these repos regardless of license. Everything above is a
pattern description, not code. But the license survey itself is a useful, somewhat alarming data
point about hygiene in this ecosystem:

- **4 of 9** repos (chongdashu, sam-david, avdo403, lilklon), including the single most-starred
  project in the entire survey, display an MIT badge or the word "MIT" in their README with **no
  LICENSE file and no license grant text anywhere in the repository**. Checked `LICENSE`,
  `LICENSE.md`, `LICENSE.txt`, and a full root-directory listing for each. GitHub's own license
  detector independently agrees, reporting "none" for all four.
- **1 of 9** (kvick-games) has the complete, standard MIT text (copyright holder and year
  included) embedded directly in its README, but no dedicated LICENSE file, so GitHub still
  reports "none." Functionally clearer than the four above, but still not machine-verifiable.
- **4 of 9** (remiphilippe, ChiR24, GenOrca, mirno-ehf) have an unambiguous, GitHub-recognized
  LICENSE file (Apache-2.0 × 2, MIT × 2), independently confirmed by us reading the raw file
  content directly.
- **0 of 9** are GPL or another copyleft license.

Practical takeaway: get our own `LICENSE` file into the repo root before or at the moment we
publish, not left implicit in the README, since roughly half the comparable projects in this
space apparently didn't.

## How we're actually different (specific, falsifiable claims only)

- **We are the only project in this survey with a confirmed persistent, incrementally-updated
  index of the project's own Blueprint structure** (functions, variables, graphs, node-type
  histograms) that is saved to disk and survives an editor restart, kept current via
  AssetRegistry change delegates rather than polling or full rescans. One competitor
  (remiphilippe/mcp-unreal) has a persistent index of comparable design, but of API documentation
  text, not the live project. Two others (GenOrca, remiphilippe) expose live, per-request
  cross-asset dependency/referencer queries with no evidence of a persisted or incremental index
  layer behind them.
- **None of the 9 surveyed repos describe a tiered, summary-first strategy for reading Blueprint
  graph contents** (list → compact per-node-type summary → full per-node pin/property detail only
  on request), the specific approach in our own M1. Two repos (ChiR24, GenOrca) do explicitly
  design for a model's context window, but both solve a different, adjacent problem: collapsing
  many operations behind one or a few gateway tools to shrink the *tool catalog*, not shrinking the
  *response payload* of any individual Blueprint read.
- **Among the 9, only ChiR24 explicitly enumerates and claims tested support across the full
  5.0–5.8 range including 5.8.** GenOrca (5.6+), chongdashu (5.5+), lilklon (5.7+), and mirno-ehf
  (5.4+) use open-ended "X.Y+" badges that would nominally include 5.8 but don't call out 5.8
  specifically; remiphilippe is hard-pinned to 5.7 only; kvick-games has only ever been tested on
  5.5 and hasn't been pushed to in over a year. We target 5.6 and 5.8 specifically (stock launcher
  installs, no engine source needed to run), which is a narrower, more explicit range than most of
  the survey states, but overlaps ChiR24's broader claim on both ends we care about.
- **The Epic-official first-party plugin, as documented for 5.8, does not compete with either of
  our stated differentiators** (no described Blueprint-structure read/summarize capability, no
  persistent index) **and doesn't exist for 5.6 at all.**
