# Milestone 3 Status: project-wide index, search, references, local-model enrichment

Last updated: 2026-08-07

> **Update 2026-08-08**: the highest-priority open question from this document, whether the
> incremental index actually stays fresh via AssetRegistry delegates without restarting the editor,
> has been tested against a real live editor and **confirmed working**. See
> [LIVE_VERIFICATION.md](LIVE_VERIFICATION.md). Everything below reflects the pre-live-test state.

## TL;DR

- **The persistent, incrementally-updated project index compiles successfully against
  the real stock UE 5.8 install**, verified the same two ways as M1/M2 (isolated
  `RunUAT BuildPlugin` + direct build against `AntiVirusSquadUE58`). Both succeeded on
  the **first attempt**, despite this milestone touching the riskiest new API surface
  yet: `IAssetRegistry`'s `OnAssetAdded`/`OnAssetRemoved`/`OnAssetRenamed`/
  `OnAssetUpdated`/`OnFilesLoaded` delegates, `GetReferencers`/`GetDependencies`, and
  `FProperty::GetCPPType()` via `TFieldIterator`.
- **All 3 new MCP tools (16 total: 5 M1 + 8 M2 + 3 M3) verified end-to-end over real MCP
  stdio**, including a dedicated set of tests for the local-model enrichment seam
  covering all three states: enrichment disabled (default pass-through), enrichment
  enabled and working, and enrichment enabled but the local model unreachable (graceful
  degradation: confirmed the tool still returns clean results, just without summaries).
- **Not verified: any of this has ever run against a live Unreal Editor.** Same gap as
  M1 and M2, restated here because it now applies to the feature that matters most for
  the user's actual stated problem, losing track of what's connected to what across a
  large project. The index's *shape* is provably correct (compiles, round-trips JSON
  correctly); whether `RebuildFull()` actually produces sensible data for
  `AntiVirusSquadUE58`'s real content, and whether the AssetRegistry delegates actually
  fire and keep it fresh as the user edits, is **completely unverified** pending that one
  manual step. See "Manual steps" below for exactly how to check this first.

## What's new

### C++ plugin: project index (`MCPProjectIndex.h`/`.cpp`, new files)

Location (source of truth): `F:\!Projects\UnrealMCP\UnrealMCPBridge\Source\UnrealMCPBridge\`
Deployed/build copy: `A:\UnrealProjects\AntiVirusSquadUE58\Plugins\UnrealMCPBridge\`

`FMCPProjectIndex` is a singleton owned by `FUnrealMCPBridgeModule` (`Initialize()` in
`StartupModule`, `Shutdown()` in `ShutdownModule`; see `UnrealMCPBridgeModule.cpp`).
Design choices, matching the M3 brief:

- **On editor startup**: only registers the 5 AssetRegistry delegates (cheap, no
  scanning). **On first request** (`search_project` or `get_project_overview` calling
  `EnsureBuilt()`): tries to load the on-disk cache first; if that fails or doesn't
  exist, does a full scan (`RebuildFull()`) that enumerates every `/Game` Blueprint via
  `IAssetRegistry::GetAssets`, loads each one (`StaticLoadObject`), and extracts:
  - Path, name, parent class, implemented interfaces (`Blueprint->ImplementedInterfaces`)
  - Every function in `Blueprint->FunctionGraphs`, with **real param/return types**,
    pulled from the compiled generated class's `UFunction` via `TFieldIterator<FProperty>`
    + `FProperty::GetCPPType()`, not re-derived from graph pins
  - Every variable in `Blueprint->NewVariables` (name, type via a pin-type-to-string
    helper, category)
  - Every graph (`Blueprint->GetAllGraphs()`), with node count and a **node-type
    histogram** (`TMap<FString, int32>`, e.g. `{"K2Node_CallFunction": 8, "K2Node_IfThenElse": 2}`).
    Cheap, no per-node detail, per the brief.
- **Persisted to disk** at `<ProjectDir>/Saved/UnrealMCPBridge/index.json` (via
  `FPaths::ProjectSavedDir()`), hand-rolled JSON (de)serialization using the same
  `FJsonObject` Set/TryGet pattern as the rest of the plugin. Deliberately not
  `USTRUCT`/`UPROPERTY` + `FJsonObjectConverter`, to avoid introducing UHT reflection
  into a module that currently has none of its own reflected types. `Saved/` is already
  the standard UE gitignore convention, so this cache is expected to never be committed.
- **Kept fresh incrementally**: `OnAssetAdded`/`OnAssetRemoved`/`OnAssetRenamed`/
  `OnAssetUpdated` each re-index (or remove) just the one affected Blueprint and
  re-save the cache, with no full rescan on every edit. `OnFilesLoaded` triggers exactly one
  authoritative `RebuildFull()` if the index was built while the AssetRegistry's initial
  project scan was still in progress (tracked via `bAssetRegistryStillScanning`, also
  surfaced in `get_project_overview`'s response so a model can tell if it might be
  looking at a partial picture).

New commands in `MCPCommandHandler.cpp` (dispatch-only; all real logic lives in
`FMCPProjectIndex` or, for `find_references`, directly against `IAssetRegistry`):

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `get_project_overview` | Calls `EnsureBuilt()` then returns `FMCPProjectIndex::GetOverview()`: total counts, folder breakdown, parent-class breakdown, scanning flag. |
| `search_project` | Calls `EnsureBuilt()` then `FMCPProjectIndex::Search()`: case-insensitive substring match across blueprint/function/variable names and parent-class names, capped and clamped to `[1, 500]`. |
| `find_references` | **Does not use the index at all**. Calls `IAssetRegistry::GetReferencers`/`GetDependencies` directly on the given package, so it works for any asset (not just indexed Blueprints) and needs no prior index build. Filters out `/Script/` engine-internal packages to stay focused on project content. |

### Ground rules from M1/M2, honored

- No short generic names added (`MakeHit`, `PinTypeToString`, `ParamToJson`/`FromJson`
  etc. are all specific enough not to collide with anything in Core, and none of them
  are named `Check`/`Verify`/`MakeError`/`MakeOk`).
- Everything still runs on the game thread. `FMCPProjectIndex`'s own doc comment calls
  this out explicitly: both the TCP server's tick and the AssetRegistry's delegates fire
  on the game thread, so `Entries` needs no locking.
- Same build-verification bar: isolated `RunUAT BuildPlugin` + direct build against the
  real `AntiVirusSquadUE58.uproject`, both required and both run this session.

### MCP server: 3 new tools + optional enrichment stage

`unreal_get_project_overview`, `unreal_search_project`, `unreal_find_references` added
to `mcp-server/src/index.ts`, result types added to `types.ts`. `npm run build` and
`npx tsc --noEmit` both clean.

**`mcp-server/src/enrichment.ts` (new file)** is the local-model pluggability seam from
the brief. If `UNREAL_MCP_LOCAL_LLM_URL` is unset (default), `isEnrichmentEnabled()`
returns false and `enrichSearchHits()` is a pure pass-through: zero network calls, zero
setup, zero behavior change. If set, `unreal_search_project`'s handler calls
`enrichSearchHits()` on the bridge's raw hits before returning them: up to
`UNREAL_MCP_LOCAL_LLM_MAX_PER_CALL` (default 8) hits get a POST to
`<url>/chat/completions` (OpenAI-compatible, works with Ollama's `/v1` endpoint out of
the box), asking for a one-line natural-language guess at what the item does, attached
as a `summary` field. Any failure for an individual hit (unreachable endpoint, timeout,
malformed response) silently falls back to no summary for that hit. Enrichment can
never break a search result. Results are cached in-memory per-process, keyed by the
hit's own structural content, so repeat searches don't re-call the local model.

The response's `enrichment` field (`"local-llm"` or `"none"`) tells the calling model
whether enrichment actually ran, so it isn't left guessing why some hits do or don't
have a `summary`.

## Verification performed this session

1. **Isolated plugin package build** (`RunUAT BuildPlugin`): `Result: Succeeded`,
   `BUILD SUCCESSFUL`, first attempt.
2. **Direct build against the real project** (`UnrealBuildTool` against
   `AntiVirusSquadUE58.uproject`): `Result: Succeeded`, exit code 0, ~92s (incremental:
   recompiled `Module.UnrealMCPBridge.cpp`, `MCPCommandHandler.cpp`, `MCPProjectIndex.cpp`
   [new], `UnrealMCPBridgeModule.cpp`, relinked). Updated
   `UnrealEditor-UnrealMCPBridge.dll` is live in the project's
   `Plugins\UnrealMCPBridge\Binaries\Win64\`.
3. **TypeScript**: `npm run build` and `npx tsc --noEmit` both clean for the whole
   16-tool server.
4. **Full MCP protocol test against a fake bridge** (extending the M1/M2 technique): a
   hand-written TCP server replays `get_project_overview`/`search_project`/
   `find_references` response shapes. The real compiled `dist/index.js` was spawned and
   driven with the SDK `Client` over real stdio: confirmed all 16 tools registered (no
   more, no less), and each of the 3 new tools called with realistic arguments returned
   correctly-shaped results.
5. **Dedicated enrichment test, all three states**:
   - **Disabled (default)**: confirmed `unreal_search_project` returns hits with no
     `summary` field and `enrichment: "none"` when `UNREAL_MCP_LOCAL_LLM_URL` is unset,
     i.e. the zero-setup default path.
   - **Enabled and working**: a fake OpenAI-compatible `/chat/completions` server was
     stood up; confirmed hits under the per-call cap (5 of 8) all get a `summary` field
     and `enrichment: "local-llm"`, AND confirmed the cap itself works correctly with 12
     hits (over the default cap of 8): exactly 8 got summaries, the other 4 passed
     through untouched rather than being dropped.
   - **Enabled but unreachable**: pointed `UNREAL_MCP_LOCAL_LLM_URL` at a port nothing is
     listening on; confirmed the tool call still succeeds, still reports
     `enrichment: "local-llm"` (it did attempt to run), and every hit comes back with no
     `summary`. In other words, a broken/offline local model degrades gracefully and never breaks
     the underlying search.

This confirms the TS <-> TCP <-> JSON plumbing, and the entire enrichment seam's
control flow (on/off/cap/failure), are all correct. It does **not** confirm the C++
index's actual runtime output against real project data. See below.

## What is stubbed / unverified

Everything below requires a live Unreal Editor session, which this environment cannot
drive:

- **The index has never actually been built from real data.** `RebuildFull()` compiles
  and its logic is a straightforward extension of already-compiling M1/M2 code (same
  `StaticLoadObject`, same `GetAllGraphs`, same `NewVariables` iteration used
  elsewhere), but whether it produces sensible output for `AntiVirusSquadUE58`'s actual
  content (correct function param/return types via `FProperty::GetCPPType()`, correct
  interface names, a folder breakdown that actually reflects the project's structure)
  is unverified. `FProperty::GetCPPType()` in particular can produce verbose/unexpected
  strings for some property types (e.g. `TSubclassOf<T>`, soft references, containers of
  structs) that I have not been able to check against a real function signature.
- **The incremental delegates have never fired.** `OnAssetAdded`/`Removed`/`Renamed`/
  `Updated` all compile against the signatures I expected, but I have not created,
  deleted, renamed, or edited a single real Blueprint while the plugin was loaded, so
  whether the index actually stays fresh as claimed (the whole point of doing this
  incrementally instead of re-scanning) is unverified. If these delegates don't fire the
  way I expect (wrong signature accepted by luck, wrong event semantics, etc.), the
  index would silently go stale rather than error. This is the single most important
  thing to check first per "Manual steps" below.
- **`find_references`'s `GetReferencers`/`GetDependencies` calls compiled against the
  simplest 2-argument overload** (`(FName PackageName, TArray<FName>& Out)`), which
  exists in UE 5.8 alongside more specific category-filtered overloads. This should
  return "all dependency categories," but whether that's the most *useful* answer (e.g.
  whether it includes soft/editor-only references a user might not care about) is
  unverified against real project references.
- **Disk persistence round-trip** (`SaveToDisk`/`LoadFromDisk`) has never actually run.
  It compiles clean and the logic is straightforward JSON, but no `Saved/UnrealMCPBridge/index.json`
  has ever been written or read back for real. First run will both create and
  immediately exercise this.
- **Enrichment against a real local model** (as opposed to this session's fake HTTP
  stand-in) is unverified. The fake server proved the *protocol* (request shape sent,
  response shape expected) matches what Ollama's OpenAI-compatible endpoint documents,
  but has not been checked against an actual running Ollama instance.
- **Enrichment cache is in-memory/per-process only**, not persisted to disk. A follow-up
  could persist it alongside `index.json` (keyed the same way, invalidated the same way
  on structural change) so summaries survive an MCP server restart. Not done this
  milestone since the brief was explicit about not blocking on this feature.

## Manual steps required from the user (do these in order)

1. **Open `AntiVirusSquadUE58.uproject` in UE 5.8.** All three milestones' plugin code
   has been compiled directly into the project already, so no first-compile prompt is
   expected.
2. **Confirm the bridge is listening** (same check as M1/M2): Output Log should show
   `UnrealMCPBridge: listening on 127.0.0.1:8765`.
3. **Call `unreal_get_project_overview` first.** This is the cheapest possible check.
   Confirm `blueprintCount` roughly matches what you'd expect for this project, and that
   `folders`/`byParentClass` look like real data, not zeros or garbage. This one call
   exercises the full first-build path: `EnsureBuilt()` -> `LoadFromDisk()` fails (no
   cache yet) -> `RebuildFull()` -> scans + loads every Blueprint -> `SaveToDisk()`. If
   this looks right, the riskiest untested path in this milestone just got confirmed in
   one shot.
4. **Check that `Saved/UnrealMCPBridge/index.json` now exists** in the project folder,
   and has plausible contents (blueprint paths, function names you recognize). This
   confirms the persistence half works, independent of the in-memory data being correct.
5. **Call `unreal_search_project` with a query you know should match something** (a
   Blueprint name, a function name you know exists) and confirm the hits make sense.
6. **The most important check**: with the editor still open, **create, rename, or
   delete a Blueprint** (or add a variable to an existing one) directly in the editor,
   not through the MCP tools, then immediately call `unreal_search_project` again for
   something related to that change, **without restarting the editor**. If the change
   shows up without needing to trigger a rebuild, the incremental AssetRegistry delegate
   wiring actually works as designed. If it doesn't show up, the index has gone stale
   silently, which would be the highest-priority bug to report back.
7. **Try `unreal_find_references`** on a Blueprint you know is used somewhere (e.g.
   referenced in a level, or a parent of another Blueprint) and confirm `referencedBy`
   actually lists the right thing.
8. **Optional**: set up Ollama (see `mcp-server/README.md`'s enrichment section) and
   confirm `unreal_search_project` results start including a `summary` field that
   actually reads sensibly for real blueprint/function names, not just the fake-server
   echo this session's tests used.
9. Report back anything that looks wrong. A stale index after step 6 is the single
   highest-value thing to know about, since it would silently undermine the entire
   point of this milestone (avoiding re-enumeration) without being obviously broken.

## Blockers

**None that stopped progress.** All three build verifications across all three
milestones have now succeeded, this one on the first attempt for both, despite
having the largest and riskiest new API surface yet (5 AssetRegistry delegate
signatures, dependency-graph queries, reflection-based function signature extraction).
The engine reference source clone remains broken and was, again, a non-blocking gap,
noted again here for completeness since it's still relevant to the numeric-type-mapping
caveat carried over from M2.

The single most important open item across all three milestones remains the same, and
is now more consequential than ever: **nobody has opened the live editor.** Every
milestone's structural correctness (does it compile, does it round-trip the right JSON)
is proven; every milestone's actual runtime behavior against real project data is not.
Given M3 is specifically about *staying* correct over time (the incremental index), step
6 above (edit something live and confirm the index notices) is the single most
important manual check across all three milestones combined.
