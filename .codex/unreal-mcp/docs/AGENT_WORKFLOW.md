# Recommended agent workflow

How an AI assistant should drive these tools to build Blueprint logic reliably. This exists
because the difference between a smooth run and a flailing one is almost never model quality, it
is tool-call order. Ship this to your agent as context (a system prompt block, a Claude Code
Skill, or CLAUDE.md section) when working on an Unreal project through this MCP server.

## Starting from a sentence

The golden path below assumes you already have the tools for the job switched on. If the session
started on the `search` profile - five tools, 2,523 tokens - or you have a request in the
user's words and no plan yet, this is the step before step 0.

**`unreal_list_tools({ match: "<what the user actually said>" })`.** `match` searches tool names and
summaries first; when that finds nothing, a second index reads the sentence as a description of a
problem and answers with the tools for it, saying which words it matched so you can judge the
suggestion. It reads three intents, and they want different tools:

| the user said | read as | you get |
|---|---|---|
| "upgrades aren't showing up in the shop" | something broken | `check_data_tables`, `list_data_table_rows`, `audit_project` |
| "add a shop upgrade that increases fire rate" | something to build | `plan_feature`, `map_system` |
| "the machine gun should cost 500 instead of 300" | a value to change | `find_in_data_tables`, `search_project`, `trace_variable`, `find_source` |
| "rename FireRate to RateOfFire" | a rename | `rename_variable`, `rename_asset`, `rename_component` |
| "delete the old health variable" | a removal | `remove_variable`, `remove_function`, `remove_component` |
| "I edited the header file" | C++ | `find_source`, `compile_cpp`, `hot_reload_cpp` |

Then `unreal_enable_tools({ tools: [...] })` with the tools the row names - **not their groups**.
The row above names three; their groups hold about fifty between them, and measured on the `search`
profile the difference is **1,008 tokens** against **16,381 tokens** for the same answer, with the extra
forty-odd sitting in the prompt for the rest of the session. If you only need one call, skip enabling
altogether: `unreal_call_tool({ tool, args })` runs it and leaves the tool list untouched.

Measured on a real project: the `search` profile stands at **2,523 tokens**, one discovery reply
costs **455-557 tokens** depending on how many tools match, and then you call the tool. Three calls
from the sentence to the thing that finds the bug, and nothing enabled along the way.

Two things this saves you from. A rename is not a value change - editing the thing directly leaves
everything that referred to the old name pointing at nothing, and the rename tools rebind those
references as they go. And a C++ edit is not finished when the file is right: the running editor has
never read that file, so `unreal_hot_reload_cpp` is what makes the change real. Skipping it leaves
the code correct on disk and the editor running the old version, which looks exactly like the change
not working.

## The golden path for building a feature

0. **If anything is not working, `unreal_doctor` first.** One call checks reachability, plugin
   version, editor responsiveness, index state, node catalog, and whether PIE is running, each with
   its remedy. Do this before concluding a tool is broken, and relay the remedy to the user in plain
   language: most of these are things only they can fix, in the editor.

1. **Check the request against the project first.** `unreal_plan_feature` with the user's request in
   their own words. It reports what already exists, what a change would reach, what is genuinely
   new, and the project's own naming and folder conventions - all from the index, for a fraction of
   one Blueprint read.

   **Relay `raiseWithUser` to the user and wait** when it says a system already exists or that a
   change reaches outside it. This is the behaviour that separates a colleague from a code
   generator: asked for a stamina system, a colleague says "you already have stamina on BP_Player
   and a HUD bar reading it - extend that, or did you mean something else?" before typing anything.
   Proceeding anyway, and leaving the user to discover a duplicate system weeks later, is the exact
   thing that makes people stop trusting these tools.

2. **Orient once, cheaply.** `unreal_get_project_overview` first. It costs one index lookup and
   tells you the project's shape: how many Blueprints, in which folders, derived from what.
   `unreal_list_blueprints` narrows that to what actually exists by name or folder when the overview
   is not specific enough.

   **Not everything is a Blueprint.** If a `parentClass` is not itself a Blueprint, it is native C++
   - and the bug may well live there. `unreal_find_source` locates the file and line that declares a
   symbol, and called with no symbol at all it answers "does this project have C++, and where are its
   modules". Read and edit the file with your own tools, `unreal_compile_cpp` to check the edit built,
   and `unreal_hot_reload_cpp` to make the running editor actually run it - without that last step the
   fix sits on disk while the editor keeps executing the old code.

3. **On a shared project, check you can actually write before you start.** `unreal_asset_status` on
   anything you intend to edit. A Blueprint is a binary asset, so it is locked by whoever checked it
   out and cannot be merged afterwards; without this, you find out at save time with the work
   already done. If it is not writable, tell the user who holds it and offer something else.

4. **Map the system before you touch it.** `unreal_map_system` with the concept in the request
   ("health", "inventory", "the door system"). This is the single most important call on an
   existing project. It returns the assets that make up that system, how they reference each
   other, which are risky to change, and what to read first - from the index and dependency graph,
   without opening a single graph.

   Three things follow from the map, and skipping it is how a working project gets broken:
   - **If the system already exists, extend it. Do not build a second one.** Say what you found:
     "you already have a health system in BP_Player and BPI_Damageable; I'll add to that rather
     than making a new one." That sentence is worth more than any code you could write instead.
   - **Check `highRisk` before editing anything.** Those assets have referencers outside the
     system, so changing them is a project-wide event, not a local edit. Prefer adding to them
     over changing what is already there, and if a change is genuinely needed, say so first.
   - **Follow `readingOrder`.** It puts the most depended-on assets first because they define the
     contracts everything else obeys.

4b. **A problem with no asset named** — "something is broken", "clean this up before we ship" —
   starts at `unreal_audit_project`, not at a Blueprint. It reads every Blueprint and every Data
   Table, ranks findings by what each is likely to cost rather than by severity, and says what it
   could NOT check: how many Blueprints a check reached, how many tables it read, which classes it
   could not resolve. Pass `check` to get one kind back in full. `unreal_review_blueprint` is the
   same job for one asset once you know which.

5. **Find the details, don't enumerate.** `unreal_search_project` to locate specific functions and
   variables once the map has told you where to look. Never list everything and read through it.
   **It matches a substring, and asset names contain no spaces:** search `"ShopUpgrade"`, never
   `"shop upgrade"`, which returns an empty result that looks exactly like the project not having
   one. `unreal_find_node` matches on words and is happy with either, which is why the two behave
   differently on the same query - measured, and the reason this sentence exists.

6. **Read tiered, narrow as you go.** `unreal_list_blueprint_graphs` for a Blueprint you will
   touch, then `unreal_read_blueprint_summary` for the one graph that matters. Do not pull full
   graphs you do not need; that cost is exactly what this server exists to avoid.

7. **Check reality before writing.** For any function you are not certain about, `unreal_find_node`
   (search by intent) then `unreal_get_node_signature` (exact pins). For a class's own members -
   what a parent already gives you, what you would be duplicating - `unreal_describe_class`. Guessing Unreal's API surface
   from memory is the single most common cause of a failed edit. For any *asset* path, the same
   applies: `unreal_list_assets` rather than inventing a path. If you guess and miss, the error's
   `didYouMean` list corrects you in one step; use it rather than retrying blind.

8. **Model the data before the logic.** If the feature has more than a few related values, make a
   struct (`unreal_create_struct`); if a value is a state or a kind, make an enum
   (`unreal_create_enum`). Six loose variables and an integer standing for "Idle/Chasing/Attacking"
   are how a project becomes unmaintainable, and a zero-experience user will never refactor it
   later. Use them with `struct:<Name>` and `enum:<Name>` wherever a type string is taken.

9. **Write whole graphs, not single nodes.** `unreal_build_graph` places every node, wire, and pin
   default in ONE atomic call inside one transaction. A ten-node graph is one round trip instead of
   about twenty-five, a failure rolls the whole thing back rather than leaving half a feature, and a
   human can undo the entire feature with one Ctrl+Z. **Do not pass `x`/`y`.** The graph is laid out
   for you automatically: columns left to right, crossings minimised, exec chains straightened.

10. **Compile, and mean it.** `unreal_build_graph` compiles by default. Zero errors is the
   definition of done for a batch, not "the calls returned ok".

11. **Review before you claim it works.** `unreal_review_blueprint`. Compiling only proves the graph
   is *valid*: dead nodes, an unhandled `Cast Failed` path, leftover `Print String`, variables still
   called `NewVar`, and heavy per-frame Tick work all compile perfectly and are all things a
   reviewer would reject. The report gives you each finding, its fix, the node ids, and a single
   `nextAction`. **Act on it rather than reporting it.** If you skip this you are grading your own
   homework.

12. **Make it read well, and check that it does.** A graph that compiles can still read as scrambled
   wire, and the person who edits it next pays for that.

   - **On a graph you built:** `unreal_auto_layout_graph` ranks nodes into columns and wraps each
     execution chain in a titled comment box.
   - **On a graph somebody else maintains:** do NOT run it. It relays out the WHOLE graph - measured
     once at 209 of their nodes moved to place 4 of yours, and in this project it left `GM_Gameplay`
     with 63 of its 206 nodes at x=0 and **eleven comment boxes naming systems that had moved out
     from under them**. Nothing in a compile shows that, and geometry cannot undo it: once the nodes
     have moved, nothing in their positions or their wiring says which box used to own them. Use
     `unreal_tidy_layout` with a `minY`/`maxY` scope, which moves nothing outside it and never
     carries a node across a comment box edge, and box your own system with
     `unreal_organize_graph add_comment_box`.
   - **Then check it:** `unreal_review_layout` reports what a compile cannot - chains running
     leftward, stacked nodes, canvas-crossing wires, nodes in no comment box, boxes that
     half-overlap, boxes left holding nothing. Measured on a real project, hand-written code ran 369
     execution wires with 0 backwards; generated code ran 4 backwards in 50.
   - **Do not invent box geometry.** An `unboxed` finding carries `suggest`: rectangles already
     cleared against every existing box and node, one per system, ready for `add_comment_box`. The
     two ways a box goes wrong are both silent - padding past a neighbour's edge makes a partial
     overlap that corrupts both when either is dragged, and a box a little too wide adopts somebody
     else's node - and both have happened here. When a box is one or two nodes short of fitting,
     `almost` names what is in the way. When neither appears there is no safe box, which is a
     finding, not a prompt to guess one.
   - **Match the project, not this document.** `unreal_review_layout` with `pathPrefix` measures the
     conventions of whatever project you are in: how many nodes a box holds, how long titles run,
     how much nests, what a normal wire length is. Those numbers beat any rule of thumb written here.
   - **Never move nodes with your own arithmetic.** `unreal_tidy_layout` checks every move against
     what is already there and against the comment box that owns each node; a hand-computed shift
     checks nothing. Splitting one 33-node box into named parts this way moved 30 nodes by a fixed
     offset and turned a clean system into seven faults - two chains reading backwards, five stacked
     pairs, one of them at *exactly* the same coordinates as another node. Reversing it by
     subtracting the same offset made it worse again, because the band boundaries then caught ten
     nodes that had never moved. It took a snapshot taken *before* the attempt to put back
     precisely. If you need room, widen `gap` on `unreal_tidy_layout` and let it place things.
   - **Read a graph's positions before you change them, and keep that read.** It is the only
     reliable undo: the editor's own is out of reach from here, and a reverse calculation is a guess
     dressed as a fix.

   Put the prose on the comment BOX, not on the nodes. One short line on a node, or nothing; a
   paragraph renders as a box that dwarfs the node it explains.

13. **Prove it runs, if you can.** Compiling proves validity; running proves behaviour.
    `unreal_start_pie` (with `numPlayers` > 1 to exercise replication), poll `unreal_pie_status`
    because PIE starts on the next tick, and `unreal_stop_pie` when done. Always stop PIE before
    editing further: writes during PIE apply to the editor world, not the running one, so they look
    like they did nothing.

14. **Save.** `unreal_save_blueprint` for a Blueprint, `unreal_save_level` for actors you placed,
    and `unreal_save_asset` for everything else you touched - a Data Table, a Data Asset, a Material
    Instance, an Input Mapping Context. Edits live only in editor memory until saved, and a tool that
    reports `changed: true` has changed the asset in memory and nothing on disk.

15. **Verify before you say it is done.** `unreal_verify_feature`. This is the step that separates
    "the calls returned ok" from "the work is finished", and it is the one most easily skipped
    because everything already looks fine.

    It compiles and reviews **every** asset written this session, not the one you touched last -
    the usual way work gets reported finished when it is not is an asset edited twenty calls ago
    that no longer compiles. It also checks the Data Table rows written this session for references
    that resolve to nothing, and asks whether the functions this session created are actually
    **called by anything**: a function that compiles, scores well and is reached by nothing does
    nothing, which is the commonest way a finished-looking feature turns out not to work.

    Its verdict is the answer. If it says `fail`, the work is not done, however good the last call
    looked.

### If a tool you need is not in your tool list

The server may be running the `lazy` profile, which starts with the authoring path above and keeps
the rest switched off until asked. Call `unreal_enable_tools` with the groups you need - `ui`,
`data`, `scene`, `edit`, `maintenance` - in one call rather than discovering them one at a time.
Groups are the right unit *here*, where you are about to author for a while and will call many of
them; for two or three known tools, `tools: [...]` is far cheaper, and for exactly one, `call_tool`
costs nothing at all.
Everything in the golden path is always available without enabling anything.

## Sharp edges that remain

Learned by building a full replicated multiplayer feature through these tools; every item below
cost one failed call to discover:

- **The target pin on function calls is named `self`**, even though the editor displays it as
  "Target". Wire component and object targets to `.self`.
- **Cast output pins on Blueprint classes contain spaces**: casting to `BP_VacuumPlayer` yields
  a pin named `AsBP Vacuum Player`, not `AsBP_VacuumPlayer`. Native classes have no spaces
  (`AsPawn`).
- **Struct pin defaults are comma triples**: vectors and rotators take `"0, -90, 0"`, never the
  named form `"(Pitch=0,Yaw=-90)"`. Rotator order is Pitch, Yaw, Roll.
- **Enum pin defaults take the entry name**: `"SnapToTarget"`, `"MOVE_Falling"`.
- **Create events before their callers.** A `CallFunction` for a CustomEvent (or a function from
  `unreal_create_function`) resolves against the skeleton class, which updates when the event is
  created, so within one `build_graph` batch order the event node earlier in the `nodes` array.
- **Re-runs are not free.** A script that dies mid-way and is re-run will re-create every
  CustomEvent it already made (auto-renamed `Name_0`, `Name_1`) and orphan the old chains as
  dead spaghetti. Before re-running authoring steps, read the graph and skip what already
  exists, or clean up duplicates deliberately.

- **The echoed value is not evidence.** A reply that repeats what you asked for tells you the request
  was parsed, not that anything changed. Three commands were found in one session reporting success
  and changing nothing: a class pin that stayed empty while `set_pin_default_value` returned
  `{"set": true, "value": "/Script/Engine.SplineMeshComponent"}`, a `build_graph` reporting
  `pinDefaultsSet: 5` with one of the five kept nothing, and `set_variable_type` returning
  `to: object:Actor` on a variable that was still its old type. All three now read the artifact back
  and say what it holds - but **the habit is the protection, not the fix**, because the next command
  to grow this bug will not have been found yet.
  **Read it back with a DIFFERENT command.** `unreal_read_node_detail` for a pin, `unreal_list_variables`
  for a type, `unreal_list_components` with `component` for a component property, `unreal_explain_graph`
  for a chain. A reply agreeing with itself proves nothing.
  This matters most where an empty value is LEGAL: an unset class pin compiles perfectly and returns
  nothing at runtime, so the failure never appears as an error - only as a feature that quietly does
  nothing.

- **Exec pin names are not uniform.** Regular nodes use `execute` (in) and `then` (out). Branch
  outputs are `then`/`else`. Sequence outputs are `then_0`/`then_1`. **Macro nodes (ForEachLoop,
  WhileLoop, ...) use `Exec` with a capital E** as their input. When unsure, read the node's
  detail; its pins are ground truth.
- **The project index updates asynchronously.** An asset you just created is normally searchable
  immediately, but a search issued in the same breath as the create can miss it, and after heavy
  asset churn it can take a second or two. You do not need to search for something you just made -
  the create call returned its path - but if you do, retry briefly before concluding it is absent.
- **`set_pin_default_value` refuses connected pins** (`pin_is_connected`). Disconnect first, or
  reconsider which pin you meant.
- **Variables must exist before `VariableGet`/`VariableSet` nodes reference them**, via
  `unreal_add_variable`. Inherited parent-class variables are not supported yet.
- **`CallFunction` needs `className` for static library functions.** `PrintString` lives on
  `/Script/Engine.KismetSystemLibrary`, not on your Blueprint. `unreal_find_node` gives you the
  right `className` so you never guess.
- **Never pass `x`/`y`.** Not "usually" - ever. This page used to say the coordinates were harmlessly
  discarded, and that was wrong in the one case that matters: `build_graph` only lays out a graph it
  effectively built, and on a graph that already had nodes it leaves everything where it was put. So
  the numbers ARE honoured, precisely where guessing is most destructive.

  A full graph has no gaps. An invented coordinate does not land in one - it lands on somebody's
  existing system. Sixty nodes went into a 982-node `BP_Player` this way, across four regions,
  interleaved with 154 of the owner's nodes; it compiled, it ran, and his verdict was *"it's like
  taking headphones and you scramble the wires."*

  Omit them and each node is placed beside whatever it connects to, which is both correct and free.

  **A standalone system is also boxed for you**, titled from its entry event in the shape the
  project actually uses - `CE_ServerToggleHealPrompt` becomes `Server Toggle Heal Prompt`, and
  several events sharing a word become one box named for the word they share. Only when the graph
  already uses boxes, or is big enough that this one would: measured across 148 graphs, 8% of graphs
  under 10 nodes carry a comment box and 100% of graphs over 80 do, so a titled box dropped into a
  twelve-node graph is a foreign convention rather than tidiness.

  What is left for you is the part no algorithm can infer: **the prose**. A box's first line is its
  name and everything after it is the explanation, and this project's convention is that the
  explanation lives on the box rather than on the nodes. The geometry, the placement and the name
  are handled; why the system works the way it does is not.

## Working in a real project (not a scratch one)

- **Touch only what the task names.** If movement already works, do not rebuild movement. Read
  first (`search_project`, graph summaries), reuse existing functions and events, and add the
  smallest graph that delivers the request. The owner's test of good judgment: "if I don't need
  to touch a system that's already in the event graph, I won't touch it."
- **Read the graph before placing nodes.** Fresh Actor Blueprints ship with stub events
  (BeginPlay, Overlap, Tick) near the origin, and existing projects have real logic there. Take
  the max extents from `read_blueprint_summary` and place new work clear of them, or your nodes
  will land on top of theirs.
- **Comment boxes carry the narrative; node comments carry the why.** Fill both. A box whose
  text is just "Comment" is worse than no box.

## Building UI (UMG has two traps, and everyone hits both)

- **A Button holds exactly one child.** To put a label on a button: add the `Button`, then add a
  `TextBlock` with `parent` set to the button. A second child is refused with `parent_full`.
- **Layout lives on the slot, not the widget.** Position, size, padding, alignment, anchors and
  ZOrder are set with `unreal_set_widget_property` and `onSlot: true`. `unreal_add_widget` tells you
  which slot class you got, because it differs per parent panel and determines which layout
  properties exist at all.
- **Anchor things that should survive a resolution change.** A HUD element pinned to a corner
  should be anchored to that corner, not placed at fixed coordinates. This is most of the
  difference between UI that looks professional and UI that falls apart on someone else's monitor.
- **Choose the root panel for the job.** `CanvasPanel` (the default) allows free positioning;
  `VerticalBox`/`HorizontalBox` lay themselves out, which is far easier to keep tidy than absolute
  coordinates when the content is a list or a row.
- **A widget that is never added to the viewport is invisible.** This is the most common reason UI
  work appears to have done nothing. Creating the Widget Blueprint is half the job; a Create Widget
  plus Add to Viewport chain in a gameplay Blueprint is the other half.

## Multiplayer judgment (learned the hard way)

- **Never attach a player-controlled Character to another to carry it.** The victim's own client
  keeps predicting and sending moves, so the attachment fights corrections: the held player faces
  its own control rotation, rubber-bands, and server-side launches get swallowed into net snaps.
  Three fix rounds failed before the architecture changed.
- **The carry pattern that works**: make the capture/release events **Multicast reliable** so
  every machine, including the victim's own client, mirrors the state locally (disable its
  CharacterMovement locally, toggle collision locally). Hold-follow runs on the victim's own
  Tick on every machine (snap to the captor's hold point and rotation), which makes rotation
  follow with zero replication lag. `LaunchCharacter` inside the multicast means the victim's
  client predicts its own launch, so it tracks the aim without correction snaps.
- **Aim from the camera, not the character.** "Launch where I'm looking" means a line trace from
  the camera to find the looked-at point, then a velocity from the victim TOWARD that point,
  ideally distance-scaled. Launching along control-rotation-forward is parallel to the camera ray
  but offset, and feels wrong exactly at short range.
- **Traces execute.** `LineTraceSingle` and friends have exec pins; wired as if pure, the compiler
  prunes them and the hit is silently default.
- **Deleting a CustomEvent does not free its name until the Blueprint compiles.** Recreating an
  event with the same name before compiling yields `Name_0` and breaks every caller. Delete,
  compile, then recreate.
- **Locate nodes by connectivity, never by first title match.** Repeated surgeries leave
  duplicate survivors; a refactor that grabs "the" node by title can rewire a dead twin while
  the real chain dangles, and everything still compiles. When something compiles clean but does
  nothing at runtime, dump the link map and look for a severed exec chain first.
- **Class pins can go stale across recompiles within a session.** A literal Blueprint-class pin
  default set early can end up pointing at a reinstanced generation and silently match nothing.
  Prefer native base classes on scan pins (filter with a Cast), or re-set class pins after the
  final compile.
- **Debug prints are a first-class diagnostic.** When behavior contradicts a clean compile,
  splice PrintStrings (prefix them, e.g. "DBG") at each stage of the chain, run PIE, and read
  which stage never fires. Strip them by bridging each print's exec source to its target before
  removing the node.

## Performance judgment (Blueprint cost is real)

- **`GetAllActorsOfClass` is not free**, and neither is anything else that scans the world. Never
  put it on Tick. Prefer a looping timer (0.1-0.2s is imperceptible for gameplay scans) that only
  exists while the feature is active: start it in the event that turns the feature on, clear it in
  the event that turns it off. Caching a found actor is even cheaper, but remember late joiners.
- **Keep casts out of hot loops** where the design allows: filter cheaply first (distance, tags),
  cast last, or type the data so no cast is needed.
- **Treat compile warnings as failures** for graphs you author. `unreal_compile_blueprint` returns
  `warningCount` and messages; "references unknown Axis" is a warning, and it means input is
  silently dead. Zero errors AND zero warnings is the definition of done.

## Cost discipline (tokens are money)

- Prefer `search_project` and `find_node` over any read that returns more than you need.
- `find_node` hits are deliberately compact (no pin lists). Only call `get_node_signature` for
  functions you will actually place.
- If the user runs a local Ollama model, the server enriches search hits with one-line summaries
  for free; nothing needs to change in how you call the tools.
- If your tool list looks short, the server is on the `lazy` profile and is deferring groups rather
  than lacking them. Enabling a group you turn out not to need costs only its definitions, so ask
  for everything the job plausibly needs in one `unreal_enable_tools` call.

## Honesty rules

- Never report a feature as built until `unreal_compile_blueprint` returned zero errors on every
  Blueprint you touched **and** `unreal_review_blueprint` has nothing left worth acting on. "It
  compiles" is not "it is good", and the review exists precisely so that distinction is not left to
  your own judgement.
- If the review still has findings you chose not to fix, say which and why. Silently leaving them
  and reporting success is the failure mode the review was built to prevent.
- If a call fails, say what failed and what you did about it. The error strings here are designed
  to be actionable (`didYouMean`, available-macro lists, schema explanations for rejected pin
  connections); act on them, then report.
- Your edits are undoable: each write lands in the editor's undo history under an "MCP:" prefix.
  Tell the user this if they seem hesitant about letting you edit their project.
