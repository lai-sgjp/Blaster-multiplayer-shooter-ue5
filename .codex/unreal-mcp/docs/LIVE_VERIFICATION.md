# Live Verification: first real session against a running Editor

Date: 2026-08-08. Target: `A:\UnrealProjects\AntiVirusSquadUE58` (UE 5.8, stock launcher install),
a real ~20-Blueprint game project, not a synthetic test project.

Every milestone up to this point had been build-verified and protocol-verified, but never run
against an actual open Unreal Editor (see the "unverified" sections of `M1_STATUS.md`,
`M2_STATUS.md`, and `M3_STATUS.md`). This session closes that gap.

## What was tested, against real project data

1. **Editor loads the plugin correctly.** Output Log confirmed:
   ```
   LogPluginManager: Mounting Project plugin UnrealMCPBridge
   LogModuleManager: InternalLoadLibrary: 'UnrealMCPBridge' (...UnrealEditor-UnrealMCPBridge.dll)
   LogMCPBridge: UnrealMCPBridge: listening on 127.0.0.1:8765
   ```
2. **Read path (M1), against real data**: `ping`, `get_project_overview`, `list_blueprints`,
   `search_project`, `list_blueprint_graphs`, `find_references`, `read_blueprint_graph_summary`
   all returned correct, sane results against the real project: 19 real Blueprints (e.g.
   `AVS_GameInstance`, `BP_Vacuum`, `WB_MainMenu`), correct parent classes, correct graph/node
   counts (134+ graphs, 1200+ nodes project-wide).
3. **Write path (M2), live**: `create_blueprint` → `add_node` (Event) → `compile_blueprint` →
   `save_blueprint` all succeeded against the real editor, producing a real, saved, compiling
   Blueprint asset (`/Game/_MCPTest/BP_MCPLiveTest2`). Then `add_node` (CallFunction: PrintString)
   → `set_pin_default_value` → `connect_pins` → `compile_blueprint` → `save_blueprint` produced a
   real, working `BeginPlay → Print String` graph. The screenshot below is that exact graph, opened
   in the real Blueprint editor.
4. **Index freshness (M3), live, without restarting the editor**: `get_project_overview`'s
   `blueprintCount` incremented immediately after `create_blueprint`, and `search_project` found
   the new Blueprint by name immediately, confirming the `IAssetRegistry` delegate-driven
   incremental index actually works, not just compiles. This was the single highest-priority
   unverified claim across all three milestones.

## Bug found and fixed during this session

`add_node` with `nodeType: "Event"` created a **duplicate** override-event node instead of
reusing an existing one. This only shows up against a real editor: new Actor-derived Blueprints
come with pre-populated, disconnected stub event nodes (`BeginPlay`, `ActorBeginOverlap`, `Tick`)
that don't exist in a synthetic/mocked graph. The first live `add_node(eventName="ReceiveBeginPlay")`
call created a second `Event BeginPlay` node alongside the existing one instead of recognizing it.

Fixed in `MCPCommandHandler.cpp`'s `HandleAddNode`: before creating a new override-event node, the
graph's existing nodes are checked for a `UK2Node_Event` with a matching `EventReference`. If one
exists, its id is returned with `alreadyExisted: true` instead of creating a duplicate, matching
how the real Blueprint editor behaves when you re-add an event that's already there. Verified fixed
via Live Coding-style rebuild + relaunch + a repeat test showing the node count staying at 3 (not 4)
with `alreadyExisted: true` in the response.

## Screenshot

This is the real Unreal Editor, real Blueprint editor, showing `BP_MCPLiveTest2`'s `EventGraph`
after the tool calls above, not a mockup. The greyed-out `ActorBeginOverlap`/`Tick` nodes are
UE's own default stub events, unconnected and correctly reported as disabled by the engine itself.

## What's still not covered

- Only `create_blueprint`, `add_node` (Event + CallFunction), `set_pin_default_value`,
  `connect_pins`, `compile_blueprint`, `save_blueprint`, and all of M1/M3's read commands have run
  live. `add_variable`, `remove_node`, `read_blueprint_node_detail`, and `add_node` with
  `CustomEvent`/`VariableGet`/`VariableSet` have not yet been exercised against a live editor.
- Only tested on UE 5.8. UE 5.6 build/live-test still outstanding.
- Only tested against one project. Behavior against Blueprints with more exotic node types
  (macros, timelines, interfaces with default implementations) is unverified.

## Two engines means two builds

This plugin supports UE 5.6 and 5.8. Keeping both honest used to be a human remembering to do the
second one, and that failed three times - each time producing a failure that looked like broken code
and was really a binary older than the change:

- a guard that "could not fire on a fresh project" (it could; the binary predated it)
- `add_variable did not report the parent class` (it did; built for 5.6, exercised on 5.8)
- and an hour spent on a hang that turned out to be a modal dialog on a force-killed editor

Each one sent the investigation into the wrong codebase, which is the expensive part. So it is now
impossible to do quietly.

### `npm run build:engines`

Syncs the plugin source into every configured project and builds against every engine, and
**refuses to report success unless every target actually built** - a partial success reported as
success is the original problem restated. It requires both a zero exit code and `Result: Succeeded`
in the output, because trusting an exit code alone is its own genre of bug.

Targets live in `mcp-server/build-targets.json`, since engine and project paths are specific to a
machine:

```json
{
  "targets": [
    { "name": "5.6", "engine": "M:/Unreal/UE_5.6", "project": "A:/.../Test56.uproject" },
    { "name": "5.8", "engine": "F:/UE_5.8",        "project": "A:/.../Real58.uproject" }
  ]
}
```

### The binary says how old it is

The editor cannot tell you its plugin is stale, but the plugin can: `ping` now reports
`pluginBuiltAt`, stamped at compile time.

`live-verify` checks that before running anything and **fails outright** if the running plugin is
older than the newest source file. A warning at the top of a hundred passing checks is a warning
nobody reads; refusing to start is a sentence somebody acts on:

```
the running plugin was built Aug 18 2026 09:14:02, which is older than the newest
source. This editor is not running the code you just wrote - rebuild for 5.8 and
restart.
```

There is a minute of slack, because the compiler stamps each translation unit as it reaches it, so
a build that began just before the last save can still contain the change.

`npm run check:fresh` runs the same check on its own.

### Why this is in a project about Blueprints

It is not really about engine versions. It is the same rule the rest of this project keeps
rediscovering: **a check that can be skipped by a person having a bad day is not a check.** The
parity guard, the docs guard, the profile budget and this all exist for the same reason, and each
was added after the thing it prevents had already happened at least once.

## Behaving like a strict client

Every measurement in this project has been taken through its own benchmark harness or through Claude
Code. Both are lenient in ways a stricter client is not, and **every bug found by changing vantage
point was invisible from the old one** - a real project instead of a scratch one, a stranger's clone
instead of the working copy. The harness alone has been wrong four times in ways that looked exactly
like product failures.

So `npm run check:protocol` behaves like a client that forgives nothing. It needs no editor, because
all of it is protocol rather than engine.

It checks the handshake (`protocolVersion`, `serverInfo`, declared capabilities), every tool's name
and schema, how failures come back, the prompts surface, and concurrency.

### The one that would have hurt

This server enables tools at runtime and sends `notifications/tools/list_changed`. **A client only
re-reads the tool list if the server declared `capabilities.tools.listChanged`.** Undeclared, every
lazily-enabled tool stays invisible and `unreal_enable_tools` silently does nothing - which is
precisely the failure the benchmark harness had, arrived at from the other side.

It turned out to be declared correctly. That is a guard now rather than a fix.

### What it found: nothing

Worth stating plainly, because a check that finds nothing is usually reported as if it had never
been run. The handshake is correct, all 73 tool names and schemas are well-formed, wrongly-typed and
missing arguments both come back as error *results* rather than JSON-RPC errors, all three prompts
round-trip, and four concurrent requests each return matched to their own id.

### Proving the checker is not vacuous

A checker nobody has ever seen fail is a checker nobody should believe - and this project has already
shipped one fixture that lied. So the server path is overridable, and the check was run against a
deliberately broken copy with an 86-character tool name:

```
  - tool name is 86 characters, over the 64 limit: unreal_ping_with_a_deliberately_...
```

One problem, precisely the injected one, and nothing else. An earlier attempt at the same test put
the broken copy outside the package, where it could not resolve `node_modules` and simply failed to
start - which proved only that the checker notices a dead server. Worth the second attempt: the
weaker version would have looked like success.

## A bug the audit found and the tools fixed, end to end (2026-08-30)

The first time the whole chain ran on its own against the live project: find, locate, verify the
convention, change one pin, re-check. Nothing about it was seeded.

`unreal_audit_project` reported one `session-lan-mismatch`, its most expensive check:

```
Hosting and searching disagree about LAN, so a lobby can be created and still never appear in
the list. LAN hosts: WB_ServerList (Create Kronos Match). Online hosts: PC_MainMenu, WB_MainMenu,
WB_HostGameButton. LAN searches: none. Online searches: WB_ServerList (Find Kronos Matches).
```

**The same widget** hosted on LAN and searched online. A lobby created from the server list is
broadcast to the local network, and the very list it was created from looks online - so it never
appears. Hosting from the main menu works, which is what makes it survive: the path people test is
not the broken one, and neither side ever reports an error.

Following the `HostParams` and `SearchParams` links to the nodes that build them:

| Node | Pin | Was |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `WB_ServerList` / `BE59B028` Make Kronos Host Params | `bIsLanMatch` | `true` |
| `WB_ServerList` / `D88EC2DF` Make Kronos Search Params | `bIsLanQuery` | `False` |

Before changing anything, every other live host path was read to find the project's convention
rather than guess one: `PC_MainMenu`, `WB_MainMenu` and `WB_HostGameButton` all build host params
with `bIsLanMatch = False`. So `False` is what the project means by hosting, and the server list was
the only path that disagreed. `unreal_set_pin_default_value`, compile, save.

`unreal_audit_project` again, same editor: **790 findings to 788**, and both session checks gone -
the mismatch and the `session-host-paths-disagree` that came with it. The verification is the audit
re-run rather than a claim, which is the only reason to trust it.

Worth noting what made this findable at all: the check is about the **project**, not about any one
Blueprint. Every fact it needs sits in a different asset from every other, and no per-asset review
could ever have put them together.


## Watching a replication bug happen, on a running game (2026-08-31)

The first time anything in this repository observed runtime behaviour rather than reading assets.
`npm run trial:runtime` against a live UE 5.6 editor, two PIE clients under one process:

```text
the bug: Ticks is not replicated
  unreplicated: worlds up                        2
      Authority  99 -> 490   changed=true
      Client       0 -> 0    changed=false
```

The trial builds an actor whose server copy increments a non-replicated counter, plays with two
players, and reads the value out of **both worlds**. The server counted to 490 and the client never
moved. That is `server-writes-unreplicated` - the check this project prices at the top of its scale,
whose entire difficulty is that it works for the host and one person cannot reproduce it - seen
happening.

### What it took, because none of it was the feature

Five runs, and every failure was somewhere else:

| Run | Failed on | Actually wrong |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | everything, silently, for 11 minutes | Open World startup map blocked the game thread |
| 2 | `ping`, in 15 seconds | the preflight added after run 1, working |
| 3 | `build_graph` | `HasAuthority` is pure; the header says `BlueprintCallable` |
| 4 | `create_blueprint` | previous run's asset survived; `matchingActors` climbed 1, 2, 3 |
| 5 | — | passes |

Run 3 is the one worth keeping. `Actor.h` declares `HasAuthority` as `UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable)`
with no `BlueprintPure`, so reading the header says "impure, wire it into the exec chain". The real
node has no exec pins at all - UHT promotes a **const** BlueprintCallable with a return value to pure
automatically. The bridge said so in one line: *"input pin 'execute' not found. Use one of: self"*.
That is the whole argument for asking the running engine instead of reading source, and it is the
error message added two days earlier paying for itself.

Run 4 is the second: `watch_runtime`'s own `matchingActors` field is what exposed the leftovers.
Three actors of one class in one world, and the sampler takes the first it finds, so the number being
reported was not reliably from the actor under test. A field added because "several actors" seemed
worth mentioning turned out to be the thing that caught a broken trial.

### What it does not prove, stated by the trial itself

The client **receiving** the value after `set_variable_replication` does not pass. The configuration
is right - `bReplicates`, `bAlwaysRelevant`, and `changed: true` from the replication call - and the
missing piece is actor identity: a level-placed actor binds to its server counterpart by a stable
path name that comes from the saved package, and this one is spawned at edit time into a map the
trial deliberately does not save. Saving was tried and is worse: `save_level` opens
`InternalPromptForCheckoutAndSave`, which blocks the game thread until a human clicks it, on an
Engine template map **and** on a project map.

The trial reports that as a `note` and still exits 0, because everything it was written to prove
passed. Turning it into a red failure would train somebody to ignore a red failure.
