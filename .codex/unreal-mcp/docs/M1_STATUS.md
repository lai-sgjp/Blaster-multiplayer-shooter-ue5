# Milestone 1 Status: read-only Blueprint introspection, end-to-end

Last updated: 2026-08-07

> **Update 2026-08-08**: the read path in this document has now been exercised against a real,
> live Unreal Editor with real project data. See [LIVE_VERIFICATION.md](LIVE_VERIFICATION.md).
> Everything below reflects the pre-live-test state.

## TL;DR

- **C++ plugin (`UnrealMCPBridge`) compiles successfully against a real, stock-launcher
  UE 5.8 install** (`F:\UE_5.8`), verified twice: once as a standalone `RunUAT BuildPlugin`
  package, and once built directly into the target project (`AntiVirusSquadUE58`) via
  `UnrealBuildTool`. See "Verified" below for exact commands/output.
- **MCP server (`mcp-server/`) builds, type-checks, and was verified end-to-end over the
  real MCP stdio protocol** (initialize handshake, `tools/list`, `tools/call`) using the
  official SDK's `Client` against the compiled `dist/index.js`.
- **Not verified: an actual live read from inside a running Unreal Editor session.**
  I cannot launch and drive the full graphical Editor from this environment. The TCP
  wire protocol between the plugin and the server was verified against a hand-written
  fake server that mimics the bridge's exact framing, but the real `FMCPTcpServer` has
  never accepted a real connection or served a real Blueprint. **This is the one thing
  the user must confirm manually** (see "Manual step required" below).
- Engine reference source clone (`A:\UnrealEngineSource\UnrealEngine-5.8`) is **broken**
  (partial/corrupt clone, not a valid git repo) and was not used for this milestone. All
  C++ was written from public UE API knowledge and corrected against real compiler errors
  from the actual engine install, which is a stronger signal than source-reading anyway.

## What compiles / runs (verified)

### C++ plugin: `UnrealMCPBridge/`

Location: `F:\!Projects\UnrealMCP\UnrealMCPBridge\` (source of truth), copied to
`A:\UnrealProjects\AntiVirusSquadUE58\Plugins\UnrealMCPBridge\` (build/runtime location).

Engine install used: `F:\UE_5.8` (found via
`C:\ProgramData\Epic\UnrealEngineLauncher\LauncherInstalled.dat`, a stock Epic Games
Launcher install, `UE_5.8`, changelist `55116800`, `IsPromotedBuild: 1`). A UE 5.6 install
also exists at `M:\Unreal\UE_5.6` but was not used since the target project pins
`"EngineAssociation": "5.8"`.

Compiler toolchain: Visual Studio 2022 Community (MSVC 14.44.35207) at `D:\community`,
found automatically by UBT.

**Verification 1: isolated plugin package build** (proves the plugin is self-contained
and correct against public APIs only):

```
F:\UE_5.8\Engine\Build\BatchFiles\RunUAT.bat BuildPlugin ^
  -Plugin="A:\UnrealProjects\AntiVirusSquadUE58\Plugins\UnrealMCPBridge\UnrealMCPBridge.uplugin" ^
  -Package="<scratch>\PluginBuild\UnrealMCPBridge" ^
  -TargetPlatforms=Win64
```

Result: `BUILD SUCCESSFUL`. Produced
`UnrealEditor-UnrealMCPBridge.dll` + `.pdb` for Win64 Development.

**Verification 2: built directly against the target project**, i.e. what actually
happens when the project's editor target compiles with this plugin enabled:

```
F:\UE_5.8\Engine\Build\BatchFiles\Build.bat UnrealEditor Win64 Development ^
  -Project="A:\UnrealProjects\AntiVirusSquadUE58\AntiVirusSquadUE58.uproject" ^
  -TargetType=Editor -Progress -NoHotReloadFromIDE
```

Result: **`Result: Succeeded`**, exit code 0, total execution time ~130s. Output binary
confirmed at `A:\UnrealProjects\AntiVirusSquadUE58\Plugins\UnrealMCPBridge\Binaries\Win64\UnrealEditor-UnrealMCPBridge.dll`
(+ `.pdb`), i.e. the binaries are already sitting in the actual target project, not just a
scratch package, so the user should not need to trigger a first-time compile prompt at all.
As a side effect this build also compiled the project's other existing plugins that needed
it (e.g. modules named `Kronos`/`KronosEditor` already present in the project), which
happened cleanly alongside `UnrealMCPBridge`. Good evidence our plugin doesn't conflict
with anything already in the project.

Note: `AntiVirusSquadUE58` is a **Blueprint-only project**. It has no `Source/` directory
of its own. Before this milestone it had no reason to ever compile anything. Adding
`UnrealMCPBridge` as a C++ plugin makes this the *first* thing in the project that
requires a build step.

Fix applied during this milestone: the first build attempt failed with C2440/C2679 errors
because a local helper function named `MakeError(...)` collided with Unreal's own global
`MakeError()` template from `Templates/ValueOrError.h` (pulled in transitively). Overload
resolution silently preferred UE's version, which returns a `TValueOrError_ErrorProxy<T>`,
not our `TSharedRef<FJsonObject>`. Renamed our helpers to `MakeOkResponse` /
`MakeErrorResponse` throughout `MCPCommandHandler.cpp` and the isolated build then
succeeded cleanly. Worth remembering for M2: avoid short generic names like `MakeError`,
`MakeOk`, `Check`, `Verify`, etc. in files that transitively include Core headers.

**Plugin registration**: `UnrealMCPBridge.uplugin` sets `"EnabledByDefault": true`, and
`AntiVirusSquadUE58.uproject`'s `Plugins` array was updated to explicitly list
`{ "Name": "UnrealMCPBridge", "Enabled": true, "TargetAllowList": ["Editor"] }` so the
plugin loads automatically, so the user should not need to enable it manually via
Edit > Plugins.

### MCP server: `mcp-server/`

Location: `F:\!Projects\UnrealMCP\mcp-server\`.

- `npm install`: succeeded, 96 packages, 0 vulnerabilities.
- `npm run build` (`tsc -p tsconfig.json`): succeeded, produced `dist/*.js` + source maps.
- `npx tsc --noEmit`: clean, zero errors.
- `node dist/index.js`: starts, connects an MCP stdio transport, logs
  `unreal-mcp-server: connected via stdio; bridge target 127.0.0.1:8765`, and stays
  running waiting for MCP client input (did not crash).

**Protocol-level verification performed this session** (both using throwaway scripts, not
checked into the repo):

1. A fake TCP server was written that replies to `ping` / `list_blueprints` / an
   intentionally-failing command using the exact line-delimited JSON framing
   `FMCPTcpServer` implements (`{id, cmd, params}\n` in, `{id, ok, result|error}\n` out).
   The real, compiled `UnrealBridgeClient` (`dist/bridgeClient.js`) was driven against it
   directly: successful responses parsed correctly, the error-response path rejected with
   the bridge's error message, and a connection-refused case (nothing listening) produced
   the expected human-readable connection error. All 4 cases passed.
2. The real compiled server (`dist/index.js`) was spawned as a child process and driven
   with the official `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` `Client` over a real stdio transport:
   `initialize` handshake succeeded, `tools/list` returned exactly the 5 expected tools
   (`unreal_ping`, `unreal_list_blueprints`, `unreal_list_blueprint_graphs`,
   `unreal_read_blueprint_summary`, `unreal_read_node_detail`), and calling `unreal_ping`
   with no bridge listening returned a graceful `isError: true` MCP tool result (not a
   crash or protocol violation) with the expected connection-refused message.

This confirms the MCP <-> TCP <-> JSON plumbing is correct on the server side. It does
**not** confirm the C++ side of that same protocol against a live editor. See below.

## What is stubbed / unverified

- **Live end-to-end read from a running Editor.** Nobody has opened
  `AntiVirusSquadUE58.uproject` in the actual Unreal Editor GUI during this milestone, so:
  - `FMCPTcpServer::Start()` binding port 8765 inside a real running editor process has
    never actually been observed (only reasoned about from the UE Sockets/TcpListener API
    and confirmed to compile).
  - No real `ping`, `list_blueprints`, `list_blueprint_graphs`,
    `read_blueprint_graph_summary`, or `read_blueprint_node_detail` call has been made
    against a real loaded Blueprint asset. The AssetRegistry/`UBlueprint`/`UEdGraph`/
    `UEdGraphPin` API usage in `MCPCommandHandler.cpp` is standard and compiles, but its
    *runtime behavior* against real project data (e.g. does `GetTagValue(FName("ParentClass"), ...)`
    actually return what I expect on this engine version's asset registry tags; does
    `TargetGraph->Nodes.IndexOfByKey(...)` correctly resolve link targets on a real graph)
    is unverified.
  - I do not have a way to launch and interact with the full graphical UnrealEditor from
    this environment (no GUI automation available here), so this genuinely requires the
    user.
- **Node id stability.** `read_blueprint_graph_summary` node ids are just `"n<index>"`
  into `UEdGraph::Nodes` at read time. They are not persisted/stable across edits or
  editor restarts. Fine for M1 (read-only, single-session), called out as a known
  limitation in `mcp-server/README.md`.
- **UE 5.6 build.** Only built/verified against 5.8 (`F:\UE_5.8`), matching the target
  project's `EngineAssociation`. A UE 5.6 install exists at `M:\Unreal\UE_5.6` but was not
  exercised. ARCHITECTURE.md notes the plugin must be built once per engine version;
  that second build is not part of this milestone's target project.
- **Engine reference source.** `A:\UnrealEngineSource\UnrealEngine-5.8` is present on disk
  but is **not a valid git repository** (`git status` fails with "not a git repository");
  it's a partial/broken clone per a long-path write failure during cloning. It was not
  used for anything in this milestone. All engine API usage came from public UE
  documentation/knowledge and was validated the hard way, by fixing real compiler errors
  against the actual installed engine headers/libs. If/when the source clone is repaired,
  it's still only useful as a reference for future milestones, not a blocker for this one.

## Manual step(s) required from the user

1. **Open `A:\UnrealProjects\AntiVirusSquadUE58\AntiVirusSquadUE58.uproject` in the Unreal
   Editor (UE 5.8).** The plugin has already been compiled directly into this project
   during this session (Verification 2 above put `UnrealEditor-UnrealMCPBridge.dll` into
   `Plugins\UnrealMCPBridge\Binaries\Win64\`), so the editor should open straight into
   normal Blueprint editing with no "binaries need building" prompt. If you *do* get
   prompted anyway (e.g. because engine version/module hash checks are picky about a build
   done outside the editor), say **yes**. It should be a fast incremental rebuild, not a
   from-scratch one.
2. **Confirm the bridge is listening**: with the editor open, check
   `Window > Developer Tools > Output Log` for a line like
   `LogMCPBridge: UnrealMCPBridge: listening on 127.0.0.1:8765`. If you instead see
   `LogMCPBridgeModule: Error: UnrealMCPBridge failed to start TCP server on port 8765`,
   something else on the machine already owns port 8765. Check for a stale prior editor
   instance still running.
3. **Smoke-test from the mcp-server side** once the editor is open, from
   `F:\!Projects\UnrealMCP\mcp-server`:
   ```
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```
   then, from any MCP client (Claude Code: `claude mcp add unreal -- node "F:/!Projects/UnrealMCP/mcp-server/dist/index.js"`,
   then ask it to call `unreal_ping`) confirm you get back
   `{"status":"ok","plugin":"UnrealMCPBridge","protocolVersion":1}` instead of a connection
   error. This is the one link in the chain nobody has exercised yet.
4. Once `unreal_ping` works, try `unreal_list_blueprints` to confirm the AssetRegistry
   query actually enumerates real Blueprints in `AntiVirusSquadUE58`'s Content folder, then
   pick one and try `unreal_list_blueprint_graphs` -> `unreal_read_blueprint_summary` on
   it. Report back anything that looks wrong (wrong parent class names, missing graphs,
   empty pin lists on graphs you know have connections, etc.). Those are the most likely
   spots for a first-contact bug given none of this has touched real data yet.

## Blockers

**None that stopped progress.** The one real risk factor (no engine install on the
machine at all) did not materialize: a stock UE 5.8 launcher install was found at
`F:\UE_5.8` and successfully used for two independent build verifications. The broken
engine source clone was a non-blocking gap (reference material only, per the architecture
doc) and is being handled outside this task.

The single most important open item is the **unverified live-editor read** described
above. Everything that can be checked without a GUI session has been checked; the
remaining risk is entirely in runtime behavior against real Editor/AssetRegistry state
that only manifests once a human opens the project.
